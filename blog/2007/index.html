2007!! What a year. The highlight would have to be the arrival of Kaelan
in March. The low point would have to be the admin assistants involvement 
in Kaelans creation.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>31th Dec 2007</strong>
<p>
Don't think I can do much celebrating. Too ill.
</p>
<p>
Though I would like to say thanks to all my fans on this last day of 2007. 
You really are the best. My life is a source of constant inspiration to you
and I am really happy for the light that I shine. 
2007 made me an inspiration to mums all round the globe. Thanks, thanks, thanks.
</p>

<p>
Still feeling ill. When will this damned flu go....
</p>
<p>
My, almost 2008. What will Kaelan acheive this year? More importantly, what will I achieve? I
can feel something brewing.
</p>

<p>
Driving back down to The Farm today. Though we had one last vistor before we left. The
admin assistants cousin, Cologne. First time I have met him and surprising how Kaelan took
to him. I wonder if Kaelan knows these are his family? The travesty probably hasn't dawned
on him yet...
</p>
<hr>
<strong>25th Dec 2007</strong>
<p>
Kaelan's first Christmas!! He seemed a little underwhelmed to be honest. I think the 
importance of receiving all these presents was lost on him.
</p>
<p>
Frando, Wee'dith and Bobby Many Bellies came round to Sid and Nancies house on Christmas 
morn. They were all in a jovial mood and were transfixed by Kalean. As is the norm.
</p>
<p>
Then off to Problem and Princess Leah's house for Christmas Dinner. Their off-spring were
there of course, causing mayhem. As is the norm it seems.
</p>
<p>
All in all venjoyable. Though it may come as no surprise that the admin assistant 
did not buy me a pressie. Said he forgot. I almost took the cuff-links with Kaelans
finger prints back from him. Idiot.
</p>
<p>
Oh and thank you for all your pressies and wishes of love and gratitude. 
I am here for you after all....
</p>
<hr>
<strong>24th Dec 2007</strong>
<p>
What was I thinking? Here I am in Scotland. Nero is with me, to keep me 
and Kaelan safe. You can imagine the faces of the hobbits when I arrived.
</p>
<p>
Then went shopping in Hobawick. Quite an experience!! Lots of Hobbit Balls on sale. 
How do they procreate?
</p>
<p>
Having some wine tonight. Princess Leah is going to mull it. 
Apparently, they have a special process of mullation up here. 
I really do not want to know what they do to it, since I have heard such disgusting 
rumours about thier Haggis procedures.
I shall be polite, no matter. Good stock must act accordingly, of course.
</p>
<p>
I expect to see some more of the 'family' tomorrow. What joy. 
Also,
No doubt they will expect me to give a speach, after dinner.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>23th Dec 2007</strong>
<p>
I had the hobbits on the phone last night pleading for me and Kaelan to go up there
for Christmas...
</p>
<p>
I am too ill to even get out of bed, never mind drive 400 miles to spend a couple of 
days in a frozen bog. 
</p>
<p>
As I have said, Christmas is cancelled this year.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>22th Dec 2007</strong>
<p>
Kaelan was getting in to the Christmas spirit this morning. Swinging back and forth
to Kirsty McColl and the Pogues so he was.
</p>
<p>
However, this is the only festivity allowed in this house this year. If I cannot partake, there
will be no fun! Still ill. Vill.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>21th Dec 2007</strong>
<p>
That's it. Christmas has been officially cancelled. 
I'm going to hibernate until I recover from this flu. See you all next year...
</p>
<hr>
<strong>19th Dec 2007</strong>
<p>
I have been very ill over the last few days. Think I may cancel Christmas.
</p>
<p>
How selfish of me, it is Kaelans first Christmas. But he'll need to understand who
is the most important.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>17th Dec 2007</strong>
<p>
Parties, parties parties. 2 parties lined up for today!
</p>
<hr>
<strong>16th Dec 2007</strong>
<p>
My, it is cold. So cold infact, that Kaelan has booger growths appearing under his nose almost every morning. 
Quite seriously! These
green browny things compact over night and look quite menacing. They are about the size of half-pence piece
and quite as hard.
What is more they are attached like limpits and are very difficult to remove. Indeed, on the first morning
one of these booger taches appeared I almost took Kaelan to hospital. I was quite traumitised
when I walked in on my child and what looked like an Amazon rain forest parasite was clamped on his face.
Oh, having a child is 
challenging. Let me tell you.
</p>
<p>
Also, Christmas is so near! How exciting.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>15th Dec 2007</strong>
<p>
Having friends round this evening. SOF&HK and A&L. Am getting the admin
assistant to do a roast chicken. It better be good.
</p>

<strong>14th Dec 2007</strong>
<p>
First Nero shits, then Ruuskii shits, then Pasha shits, then Kaelan fills his nappy.

Then Nero shits, then Ruuskii shits, then Pasha shits, then Kaelan fills his nappy.
</p>
<p>
Then I 'pee'.

</p>
<p>
Ad infinitum....

<p>
One of my pees blocked the toilet today! What a coincidence.
</p>
<p>
Also, I am starting to understand silence means naughty.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>11th Dec 2007</strong>
<p>
I don't poo. Obviously. Though my pees have blocked the toilet on more than one occaision.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>10th Dec 2007</strong>
<p>
Kaelan fills his nappy approx 4 times a day.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>9th Dec 2007</strong>
<p>
Going north today. To see the Dicks.
</p>
<p>
Dicks' son has grown loads. He is very cute as well. Not sure why I go though,
 all they did was talk about pooing.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>8th Dec 2007</strong>
<p>
Going to Polesten Lacey this evening for an Edwardian experience. S&J are escorting me.
</p>
<p>
Kaelan is enjoying his advent calendar a tad too much.
</p>
<p>
Polesten Lacey was over-hyped. And Kaelan didn't get to see Father Christmas. Think I may complain.
</p>
<p>
Pasha is going on hols this Christmas. To S&Js. He is looking forward to it.
</p>

They say chimps and dolphins are intelligent. 
They say elephants have a quality intellect and a capable memory. They even
say pigs are a worthy match for us! But, more importantly, to judge properly, 
 can we really ascribe these animals human qualities? For example, how imaginative are they?
Are they really as imaginative as humans?
</p>
<p>
Perhaps, if you try really hard, you can imagine what it is to be like to be short and squat.
(like a pig)
</p>
<p>
Perhaps, if you try really hard, you can imagine what it is to be lazy.
(like a chimp perhaps? they do sleep alot)
</p>
<p>
Perhaps, if you try really hard, you can imagine what it is to be like to be ancient, older than 
many of the old, old, old things. (perhaps as old as an an elephant. They do live a long time)
</p>
<p>
For you, to imagine all these things may be unnatural and strain your 
reality envelope to its edge. But, dare I say, it may be possible, within your reach,
if you closed your eyes and imagined a calamity. 
</p>
<p>
For Sid Hobbit, its easy....
</p>
<p>
Ah yes, it is Sid's birthday today. He is 765 years old (nearly as old a Moses).
He doesn't do a stitch of housework (like a lazy toad). And he is a hobbit. SAY NO MORE!!!
</p>
<p>
Happy birthday Sid!! Nearly as old as Nancy, but not quite.

<p>
Over the last week or two I have gained a puppy. He is called Kaelan and he follows
me from room to room. Crawling. He is getting good at it. Climbing up stairs 
proficiently. I knew Nero was the dad.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>2nd Dec 2007</strong>
<p>
J was spectacular!! He really is a star on the rise. What pizazz, what aplomb he has.
Even though he and his fellow actors are an amateur outfit and they 
had to share the stage with another group performing another play at the same time,
he gave a performance of such magnitude and majesty I doubt he will ever need to go back to being 
a postman again. I never realised the depth of his character. The span
of emotions this man could conjur were breath taking. From light-hearted jocular moments, 
to phases of such gravitas and sublimity many of the audience were trembling in their
seats. Oh what powerful stuff.
</p>
<p>
J's presence on stage was truly amazing, women were throwing themselves at him.
S almost fainted when one of the cast starting snogging her husband (tongues and everything)
right in front of her.
I had a word with S, just to reasure her that it was all pretend. Though
J's enthusiasm almost gave the game away. 
</p>
<p>
Some of the sound effects were haunting. At a couple of points in the play, a 
very curios phenomena occured: pre-echo!! Truly, I have never heard this before. 
Unlike a normal echo where a sound is acoustically repeated after
someone speaks, this was the opposite! J's lines could be heard before he 
even opened his mouth! AND he made his voice sound like a woman! Oh, what talent this man has.
</p>
<p>
I am thinking about joining a professional dramatic company. 
I never do amatuer.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>1st Dec 2007</strong>
<p>
Going to see a pantomime tonight. It better be good. J of S&J is 
apparently playing a dame. Now that doesn't surprise me one bit.
</p>
<p>
All Hope has gone!! Hope are out of the X-factor, though I didn't really like them anyway.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>30th Nov 2007</strong>
<p>
Pasha is ok. Even though he isn't 100%, he comes and sits on my lap of an evening
to watch eastenders and corrie, oh and emerdale and the X-faxtor and
Strictly Come Dancing, oh and he loves programmes about purchasing and doing up houses.
Quality TV!
</p>
<p>
Kaelan and I went for a jaunt up to see LZ. She is flourishing in her
32nd week of pregnancy. Though I'm not sure what she is thinking about, she has a
1 year old already, whats it going to be like when she has two? Is she nuts?
Though in saying that, perhaps a little brother or sister would be good for 
Kaelan. And I'm sure someone would like to be Kaelans sibling. He
is perfect. Though he developed a strange relationship with EY, LZ's
little girl. He took great enjoyment being spanked on bottom in the bath by her...
No photo's to follow.
</p>

<strong>24th Nov 2007</strong>
<p>
Pasha is at home again. He seems fine but the vet said the next renal problem
that Pasha has could have dire consequences. Poor thing. Though the vet said
he behaved impeccably while under his supervision. He is a brave soldier.
Strangely, I didn't realise renal and penal were different till the vet explained.
How embarassing.
</p>
<p>
Kaelan is getting around like a little monster. I can't believe the difference
two weeks makes. I have had to speak sternly to him on a couple of occaisions.
It really is hard for mothers chastising their little ones.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>23th Nov 2007</strong>
<p>
Pasha has had kidney failure. I think it is quite serious.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>21th Nov 2007</strong>
<p>
Pasha is staying in the vets tonight. He has been off his food for a little while
and the vet would like to get some samples from him. I hope he they look after him.
He is an old boy as well (as Nero).
</p>
<hr>
<strong>19th Nov 2007</strong>
<p>
Kaelan isn't bald any more. Thats not to say he has a full head 
of hair but if you squint with your eyes he has at least tonal variation on 
his napper. Also, he is able to pull himself up to a standing position from 
lying down. I am not suprised he is so clever.
</p>
<p>
All the millions of Astrians in world love hearing about Kaelan. If 
you are not one of them, my advice is to convert quickly.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>18th Nov 2007</strong>
<p>
Teething problems today. Of the literal kind.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>16th Nov 2007</strong>
<p>
Sunny Signers today. Venjoyable. Though people were laughing at Kaelan's 
crawling method. As I have mentioned, he has been going forward for a few weeks now but
his motion is rather seal like. You know, put ones arms forward, flop stomach along and the legs follow.
Rather inelegant but it works!!
</p>
<p>
Some of the mothers have no room to speak. Their children bounce along on their bottoms!?! Really.
How uncouth.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>15th Nov 2007</strong>
<p>
Nero nipped Kaelan today. But children must realise their importance.
Anyway, he is ok, Nero will survive to nip another day. 
And luckily Kaelan is learning fast, 
he gets that from me (though I suspect he will get nipped again, though probably not by Nero).
</p>
<hr>
<strong>13th Nov 2007</strong>
<p>
Received an email from Britney today, she says she is gonna sue because of my remarks. 
Go on you ho!! Do your worst. I have the best lawyers in the land at my disposal AND I 
have Nero.
</p>
<p>
Ah, how the years pass. 8 years ago Kaelan was just a twinkling in Nero's eye and
J was just a scrote. Not even one day old. Happy birthday J, you old coyote.
</p>
<p>
I've not heard a word from Nancy regarding my acusation of her miming. That is 
tantamount to an admission of guilt. What am I saying,...?? How could she refute?
</p>

<p>
Received an email from Kylie today, insisting she doesn't mime. I think we know better...
</p>
<p>
We took Nancy to the woods yesterday, she got on swimmingly with the wildlife, I suppose she
knows the ways of the forest animals well, she is a hobbit after all!
It was amusing when she started hunting for truffles with her snout though. She was like a 
veritable boar rummaging through the undergrowth. She was a total mess afterwards but she was
content and her stomach was full. Ah! Watching nature in all its glory, wonderful!!
</p>
<hr>
<strong>11th Nov 2007</strong>
<p>
Kaelan was in the car at 11am, and he was very quiet and respectful.
Thankyou.
</p>
<p>
So, here we have it. The hobbit X-Factor 
<a href="../../vids/foggies.wmv">vid</a>. It is truly
amazing. It is a wonder to both the dead and the living. Thankyou for giving 
us Sid and Nancy, you really did an amazing job. 
</p>
<p>
Is there a competition for the best mimer? Nancy is up there with Madonna and
Britney. I dare say she would give Kylie a run for her money as well.
Sid has left the Epsom farm, I think he was ashamed of 
Nancy's performance. Don' blame him.
I thought only school kids mimed.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>10th Nov 2007</strong>
<p>
Nana Nancy is of use though. She looked after Kaelan this morning and changed two sh*tty
nappies before 10am.
</p>
<p>
Sid is a chore avoider.
I have yet to work out a strategy that will get him involved in day to day duties.
A nip from Nero may help.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>9th Nov 2007</strong>
<p>
With great embarressment I took them around Epsom today, I even allowed them 
to come to Sunny Signers. However, I am really starting to suspect their mental age. 
They play as though they are just out of nappies, infact I'm not even sure 
they are!! Kaelan is much
more advancend than them. And we all know where his superiority comes from!
</p>
<p>
Now they want to eat the 'thing'.  That bedraggled contorted dead corpse.
Oh dear. What will become of me?
</p>
<p>
Kaelan is strong through it all, they he does get  
<a href="../../vids/milktable.wmv">tired</a>.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>8th Nov 2007</strong>
<p>
The hobbits have arrived. Though thankfully only two turned up. The elderly Sid and Nancy.
They phoned up at 6:20pm asking to be collected from Gatwick. What audacity!
The Driver finishes at 6pm so I had to fork out overtime. 
</p>
<p>
They squealed when they say Kaelan of course. It was like he was a
 popular music star. Other travellers were staring at the scene
they were making. But really, for the life of me, I do not know what Sid and Nancy were 
gibbering about. "Eiz gor-jis" and 
"let mei kae ree im" and "geeimeer" were oft repeated phrases. 
I suppose for the people that witnessed the spectacle they could then 
write home about another of their strange
experiences overseas. 
</p>
<p>
Also, I think they have brought a dead rat with them. Though they insist it is edible,
but it really does look like some kind of recently deceased small mammal. 
What's worse is I feel obliged to eat some of
it since its seems to be some kind of offering. 
They point to the cooker with such glee. And I feel so succinctly sick. Oh when do they leave?
</p>
<p>
Oh hallelujah, they are only here for a couple of days.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>6th Nov 2007</strong>
<p>
Well, I received a phone call last night; the hobbits are arriving on Thursday. How many? I know not.
For how long? I know not. I don't even think I said yes to them coming. They just sort of said
they were. Oh dear, up with the hatches, hide the silver and put Kaelan in cotton wool.
</p>
<p>
Kalean is going swimming today. He is quite a little tadpole when he gets going.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>4th Nov 2007</strong>
<p>
The admin assistant got rather excited today. Kaelan was showing an interest in his 
<a href="../../imgs/server/">server</a>.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>3rd Nov 2007</strong>
<p>
Ah, what a beautiful autumn morn. The trees are afire. I can feel a poem coming on. Perhaps later today...
</p>
<p>
Went up to Epsom Downs to watch the bonfires this evening. London was truly ablaze. There was a
good fireworks display over by Kew Gardens or somewhere by the river. Vspectacular.
</p>
<p>
Good old Guy Fawkes. He didn't die for nothing.

I know what Heather Mills feels like. Mutterings, mutterings, mutterings. Mutterings everywhere.
When you are an object of adoration, people mutter. So, all you mutterers..., f*ck off!
</p>
<p>
In saying that, she does deserve it though. Stupid ho.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>31st Oct 2007</strong>
<p>
It all started when I went to the doctors for a routine visit for me!
The doctor heard a wheeze in Kaelan's chest and checked it out. She was a bit worried and
said I should go to A&E. Perhaps it was over reaction but the A&E staff said he was OK and not
to worry unless his breathing was causing him distress, which it wasn't. Anyway,
all the staff at the hospital fussed over him and gave him the all clear. What a relief!
</p>
<p>
Just to prove he is as right as rain he has started crawling forwards today... Hurrah!!
</p>
<p>
Its a tough job being a parent. But don't worry I'm totally up to the task. Infact I'm thinking about
becoming a paediatrician, or a nursery nurse. I'm brilliant with kids. One just isn't enough.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>30th Oct 2007</strong>
<p>
Kaelan was taken to A&E this evening. It was quite traumatic. I'll give you the full update tomorrow.
He is ok though.
<!--a href="../../imgs/kscan/">Here<a> is Kaelan being an Aqua Duckling.

Developer status of Kaelan: he has aquired his second tooth. Positioned at the top this time. Coincidentally
right above his first one. Also, his standing abilities have taken an interesting twist. In the last couple of 
days he has been leaning against inanimate objects 
<i>and</i> lifting <i>and</i> moving a foot. A precursor to walking perhaps? Though I shouldn't get
my hopes up. The admin assistant was five years old before he could walk.
</p>
<p>
All foxes gone. Good luck!!

<hr>
<strong>23th Oct 2007</strong>

There was only one fox left in the stables this morning so one is wandering free already!
</p>
<p>
You know, I think I was a fox in a previous life.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>22th Oct 2007</strong>
<p>
Two foxes arrived at the farm today from a wildlife sanctuary, 
the sanctuary want to do a 'soft' release with them. 
I have put them in the stables for a couple of 
nights and left food and water for them. Hope they are ok.

The admin assistant can hardly contain myself. Says there is a big game on today,
something about a world cup. I didn't know he liked football? Anyway, I have duties for
him today, he will be kept busy, ALL DAY. Don't worry.
</p>
<p>
Here is a little <a href="../../vids/milk.wmv">vid</a>

Went horsey riding today, neigh!! Jolly good fun. Kaelan came along of course, though he
stayed in the creche. But he did play with horsey toys.
</p>
<p>
Prof. Anne was very happy today. Her youngest off-spring duplicated! Gave birth
to a baby boy, Connor. Congrats to them. Don't drink too much bubbly! We know what

Yawn! Up early today, going to London town to do some charity work. 
</p>
<p>
Wow I raised thousands! Much more than anyone else. Thats because I'm special :)))
</p>
<p>
And Epsom and Ewell is the 3rd most pleasant place to live in the UK. Thats up 14 places 
since me and Kaelan moved here...
</p>
<p>
Cough! Splutter! Somewhere in Scotland is the best place to live in Britain! 
How can that be? Oh, thats ok, its Edinburgh. Thats England really.

Going to meet up with the Epsom mothers today. They are a very select
group of some of the best mothers in Epsom. We exchange tips on how to dress
ones baby according to the latest Surrey trends. I find I am a source of
constant amazement to these mothers, they think I must've had numerous
babies due to Kaelans intrinsic style. 
</p>
<p>
Its also good to have a good moan, us gals really have a lot to grumble about. Principly, 
fathers who don't father.

    The key to me is not a big secret.
    Just bring me pressies and a nice biscuit.
    That, and a camper van to spend time in.
    With of course with my boo boo: Kaelan.
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Yes, it is little known I would like a camper van.

Kaelan is having a small problem crawling. He's worked out that pushing with his arms and feet
will make him move. However, he only pushes with one foot. This leaves him in a situation where
he is like a one armed rower, he goes round in circles.

Being a mother really does push you into new areas of human knowledge. 
I now know how to simmer a pan of water! Not too hot, not too cold. Its easy.
</p>
<p>
I am a good hausfrau in general. I hoover up the family room everyday. The other rooms
get done once a week. When the cleaners come.

Shopping is a cinch. Open up the internet, login to Sainsburys and as if by miracle
everything arrives a couple of hours later.

Mothering is a lark, I'm glad to say. Who needs a maid huh?

<strong>07th Oct 2007</strong>
<p>
Ah!!! How the years pass. 
</p>
<p>
I have come to terms with the fact that the admin assistant
had a hand in Kaelan's creation. It has taken a long time... but 
I have consoled myself to that reality.
</p>
<p>
Just as the most beautiful rose blossoms,
it must have manure spread underneath.... 
</p>
</p>
It is the paradoxicalities that make life interesting.
I can feel a poem coming on... Perhaps tomorrow.

So sorry for not keeping my blog up-to-date for approx a week. I know some of you 
have had to visit councillors. I shall reimburse your expenses, do not worry.
Importantly, I will endeavour to retrospectively fill my bog...

Here are some misc photos of this weekend:

A miracle! Kealan's first tooth has arrived. 
Its also a miracle that Nana Nancy didn't knock it out as soon as it appeared. 
She was using a metal tea spoon to feed my boo boo when she heard a
clink of metal against tooth. Luckily Kaelan is made of sterner stuff and the 
tooth remained solid. He is growing up so fast.

Put on my property developer hat today and investigated purchasing Edinburgh Castle. 
I'd like to convert it into flats. What a great idea, I'd make millions. Anyway I didn't make it through
the door, the castle staff weren't to happy with my proposition.
So I had a little jaunt through the poorer reaches of Edinburgh. The New Town just
about makes it into my league, though realistically only the Fetes College building is
something I would consider. The West End, or is it West Bank? is a tad rough, as
is Morningside.

I will never, ever understand Him. Kaelan's Christening took place today, in Hobawick. Of 
all places. Of course Kaelan took everything in his stride. He behaved impeccably in His presence
and even though the church wasn't precisely a cathedral, Kaelan was appreciative of how democratic
His influence is.
</p>
<p>
Kaelan is now filled with much holiness. He must be, he drank the baptismal water
much like a hobbit drinks whisky. It ran down his forehead onto his tongue and he never 
once blinked. Thoroughly enjoyed it.  
<a href="../../imgs/christening/">Photos</a>.
</p>
<p>
Because of the short notice, I was struggling to find god parents, but like a miracle SOF walked 
into the church. How did he know it was happening there and then? He truly works in mysterious ways.
He was very grateful
to be asked, of course. Then things started getting a bit embarassing. Some of the hobbits saw
SOF's obvious regality and thought he was up for grabs. 
They started pressing their young females on him but
he of course was not phased by any of this. He is made of special stuff.
Finally, I chose the prettiest one to accompany him and to be the god mother. 
I do think they would've made a lovely couple but
SOF wasn't entertaining the idea at all. Some times I don't understand him.
</p>
<p>
After the service, the hobbits and I made our way to a drinking inn. At this point 
I had no idea what to expect but I managed to maintain my composure while they
gnawed on sausage rolls and chicken legs. 
</p>
<p>
Frando and Wee'dith were there at the Mansfield Bar of course.
They didn't give their rendition of some craws on a wa though. 
But they did enjoy the food. It looked as though they hadn't eaten for 24 hours.
Come to think of it, they hadn't. Not since the party the night before. They probably won't eat
until Christmas now, or until the next party... Anything to save a few pennys.
</p>

<p>
Apparently it is Sid and Nancy's 400th Wedding anniversary today. They are
having a party in their burrow. How quaint.
</p>
<p>
I think the admin assistant has a sense of humour though! No, really!! 
He was invited to toast the occaision and some of the things he said made 
the other hobbits laugh. I couldn't make out a word he was saying
so the humour was lost on me. However Prof. Anne was there and she explained
the hobbits were laughing at him not with him. Nothing changes there.
<a href="../../imgs/christening/40/">Photos</a>.
</p>
<p>
My concern re the christening is growing.

<p>
I could throttle him!! That damn admin assistant. We are in Scotland. 
</p>
<p>
Whilst heading from York in the direction of Durham, I fell asleep in the limo. 
The admin assistant was at the helm and he has deliberately weasled us up here! 
What is going on!! I'm sure Kaelan is going to get baptised this weekend
but surely not in Scotland. Has He lost His marbles?
</p>
<hr>
<strong>27th Sep 2007</strong>
<p>
Drove to York today and visited the Minster. Vspectacular I must admit.
Though He didn't indicate His approval. Therefore it must be Durham for Kaelan's Christening.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>26th Sep 2007</strong>
<p>
I am going on a drive this weekend. To York and/or Durham. I have seen photos of their 
cathedrals and they are suitable. He is guiding me northwards.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>24th Sep 2007</strong>
<p>
The admin assistant cleverly put Kaelan on my bed before 
he put him in the bath. You can guess what happened...
Kaelan didn't have a nappy on and he pee'd my bed. 
That stupid admin assistant. I am surrounded by idiots.
</p>
<p>
I had a premonition in a dream last night that Kaelan will get baptised this weekend. 
Oh how exciting, but where?
</p>

<p>
Went to the 40th Aniversary of the establishment of Church of Unity in the Crundale estate,
 Orpington, yesterday. There was a 20 mile sponsored walk, everthing was going swimmingly 
until one of the marshals directed us in the wrong direction!! Idiot.
Straight in to the arms of some armed youths no less. I used my diplomatic skills to get
us out of a very tricky situation.

<p>
The X-factor vid has been greeted with much enthusiasm, so much so I may make another one. 
I have been polishing off some rather spectacular moves. I am inspired. 
Interestingly, the hobbits in Hobawick have been so inspired they have been 
practising their own routines. The next time I'm up there (if I ever go again)
I will vid them and put them up on the web site. They better be good. I shan't be 
afraid to Simon Cowell them!!
</p>
<p>
Still waiting for a sign from Him to indicate where Kaelan's christening will
take place. I know it will be a special place.

Ah what a beautiful morn here in Epsom. A clear crisp blue sky stretching 360 degs. It is 
slightly nippy but I'm sure it will rise into the twenties by 11am. Dear old England, my home.
</p>
<p>
On a slighlty different matter, no one warned me about baby poos as they get older. 
Kealans are quite foul. I have been assured by the Doctor that everything is as it should be.
Though I sometimes suspect her credentials.
</p>

2 Years ago today.... what a fateful day. Little did I 
know that my innocence would be sullied by that admin assistant.
He even bought me something as an anniversary present: a key ring!! I promptly threw it in the bin.

<p>
Went to the cinema with the Epsom Mothers this evening. 'Atonement' was on. It was a bit over acted 
and suffered from clichéd directorship.

What is the matter the lying anyway? Hardly worth making a film for.

<p>
Cathedral in Canterbury vbeatiful. Most suitable for a baptism 
I think. The city of Canterbury was also vcharming indeed.
Felt quite at home there. Though there were a tad too 
many alternative types for my conservative values.
</p>
<p>
Went via the Isle of Sheppey on the way back to the farm in Epsom. Oh dear, 
it was like a vast council estate on
a potentially beautiful part of England. I saw them stealing lead from
the abbey in Minster!! Oh dear.
</p>
<p>
Will release my X-Factor vid later on today...
</p>
<hr>
<strong>08th Sep 2007</strong>
<p>
Going to Canterbury to check out the cathedral there. I have heard it is rather lovely. 
</p>
<p>You know,
its not easy choosing a cathedral for one's sons christening. I may need some guidance from Him above.
I'm sure He will chose well. I trust Him.
</p>
<p>
Oh and the admin assistant was wittering on about wishing someone well on their wedding day....

Kaelan is 6 months old today. He is as spectaular as his mum. I think the highlight was my performance at the birth,
truly amazing. All in all he is perfect, he can do no wrong. I really believe he will be one of those children
that will never get into mischief or trouble and I will never have to tell him off. He is such a cherub.
I'm sure the sky would tumble from the heavens above if he were to think a bad thought. His heart is as pure as mine.
His mind is as innocent as mine. His soul is as unfettered by the devil as mine. His face is a angelic as mine.
He is like a biblical character (of the good sort!). Think I may go and take a peak while he sleeps. His beauty melts my
pure heart.
</p>
<p>
Importantly you will be glad hear to I have organised the vid team to come over at the weekend. My
X-Factor performace is being recorded for the first time.

Net bad eh? That was my latest Bush movement. Vcreative.

<strong>02nd Sep 2007</strong>
<p>
Think I may enter the next X-Factor auditions. 
My routine would consist of ballet and song, movements influenced by Kate Bush
and the tune would be a fanfare of triumphant violas. I would WOW those 
judges...
</p>
<p>
Perhaps I could release a 78! or are they 45s nowadays?
</p>

Kaelan propelled himself on his baby walker today. Approximately 2 feet and backwards! 
Do hope he learns to go the right way eventually.

My son may be chubby but that is no reason to say he has rolls of fat on him! Rolls? What do they mean? I almost walloped 
2 dozen people in the South of England over the last couple of days. Puppy fat yes, and cute puppy fat at that!!
</p>
<p>
Anyway, importantly Kaelan has been on his first boat trip; had his first paddle in the sea; and tasted his first 
slice of toast. <a href="../../imgs/newforestchristchurch/">Photos</a>.
</p>
<p>
Luckily my son can rise above these cheap remarks.
</p>
<p>
We also saw some wild ponies, wild cattle, and some wild trout. Though I am sure the trout were not swimming wild.
They were swimming within feet of people on the riverbank. But in saying that, they wouldn't let me stroke them...
</p>
<p>
These dirtbags will regret what they have said about Kaelan when he is 6 foot and gorgeous!! 
Sadly with the admin assistant's heritage, they may be correct and he may turn out to be a fat roli-poli
Hobbit. But that is something I will deal with we come to it...
</p>
<p>
My genes are strong. Vstrong.

Going to deepest New Forest for an adventure today. Kaelan has his camouflage's on.

<p>
Have came across some fantastic Cathedrals, Durham for example is qute amazing, Lincoln?? Very acceptable.
Just not sure which one to chose....
</p>
<p>
The admin assistant has been muttering something about having Kaelan christened in Scotland, I mean, what
is he on? Kaelan has a St Georges cross tattooed on his chest.
</p>

<p>
Rain, Rain, Rain in Epsom. Perhaps I should write a poem about rain...

Took Nero and Kaelan to church today. K caused quite a commotion, many thought he was
the second coming. I had to explain the admin assistant was the father. They were rather disappointed.
Nero stole the show with his recital of the Lords Prayer. He knows it off by heart. The things about him after all!
</p>

<p>
Had a visitation today, from the Barnard 3, soon to be 4.
</p>

<strong>17th Aug 2007</strong>
<p>
Kaelan had his second "shoot" yesterday. I suspect he may follow in the foot steps of Elvis. He
is so beautiful, and he has rhythm. And all the girls love him. The Epsom Mothers adore him, as
 do the reprobates that I went to school with. He is truly a miracle.
</p>
<p>
Have found a couple of catherdrals that I am interested in hiring for Kaelans baptism: Canterbury and York.
Westminister is a close third but all the riff-raff congregate there, don't you find.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>13th Aug 2007</strong>
<p>
Went to Lewes today, vcharming an vcivilsed. Felt right at home. S&J turned up. 
</p>
<p>
Thinking about getting Kaelan (properly) baptised. Need to find a suitable Cathederal though.
</p>
<p>
The admin assistant is trying to butter me up. I can sense it. Two days on the trot he has brought me
a bowl of freshly picked blackberrys from the bushes next to the farm gates. Whatever he wants, he isn't getting it.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>12th Aug 2007</strong>
<p>
SOF and HK dropped by today. Most delightful to see them! Though they did not curtsy... 
Perhaps they have they forgotten who I am?
</p>
<p>
The northern Dykes also visited. They came bearing more gifts. Its good to know MOST people know
to bring pressies when they receive an invitation.
</p>
<p>
Also went to the Epsom Downs play area for children. Good fun indeed. Though it was a tad
embarrassing when my dainty bottom wouldn't fit down the slide. I am quite unsure what I 
had in my pockets to stop me sliding down...

The admin assistant farted in my presence!! How disgusting. Kaelan, I can tolerate, since he is so small and harmless.
However, the admin assistant is another matter. For that there shall be 1 days wages deducted.
</p>
<p>
And he thought it was funny...
</p>
<p>
Idiot.

<p>
He is also 5 months old. Today.

Bit of a scorcher today, should be around 30C. Kaelan can take such low temperatures in his stride.
30+ on the day he was born.

Kaelan is going for his first fashion shoot today. In Beckenham. 
Someone stopped me on the street one day and said I should take him to a "studio", since he is so handsome.
Obviously the fashion house almost forced me to sign on the spot when they saw him...
</p>
<p>
The admin assistant bought a Blue Tooth dongle from ebay.

<p>
Castles in Devon not bad. But not quite what I require. Anyway Kaelan enjoyed his trip.
Went to: Barnstaple, Ilfracombe, Clovelly and  Hartland. Stayed in a small hotel in Instow. 
The woman was quite batty and reminded me of Basil Faulty. It transpired we got on swimmingly.
</p>
<p>

<p>
Going to Devon today. To checkout some property (castles 'n' stuff).
</p>
<hr>
<strong>26th Jul 2007</strong>
<p>
Kaelan has just about worked out that the muscles in his back and stomach
help him sit up. Though not every time. Sometimes he forgets and falls onto his face 
or back. I don't think being perched on top of a nappy helps either.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>24th Jul 2007</strong>
<p>
1. Never forget I am here.
</p>
<p>
2. In your darkest day, just remember me.
</p>
<p>
Importantly, Nero makes Kaelan jump when he barks. It was blithey in the summer toad.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>22th Jul 2007</strong>
<p>
Kaelan has perfected the knack of rolling himself onto his tummy. The inverse is not true.
He usually starts crying after 5-10 minutes because he is stuck.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>21th Jul 2007</strong>
<p>
Went to see JayDee today [<a href="../../imgs/dykes/200707/">photos</a>]. I offered the Scottish
couple hordes of advice on how to bring up a small baby. After all, I am an expert in these things. 
</p>
<p>
There was a tense monent when Kaelan was eyeing up Jaydee's milk and 
had a look very similar to the hobbits when they were in the
Burj al Arab. Remember the escapade when I had to to stop them pilfering the furnishings? Anyway, he didn't 
infringe on JayDee's lunch. Thankfully.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>19th Jul 2007</strong>
<p>
Thankyou for reminding me... I WAS radiant during the pregnancy and before. You are right.
I stand corrected.
</p>
<p>
Kaelan and I received a certificate today for attending a course on Baby Massage. His first 
certificate!
</p>
<p>
Importantly, I have been asked to star in a film for the International Fund for Animal Welfare. They 
require someone with PiZazz. They have chosen well.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>17th Jul 2007</strong>
<p>
I am offically below my pre-pregnancy weight. Lighter and more radiant than ever before.
</p>
<p>
Thinking about buying a house in Devon. It comes with a Title. So it would be "Lord
Kaelan". He likes it a lot.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>16th Jul 2007</strong>
<p>
Kaelan has been a bit poorly over the last couple of days but he is still cute
as anything. He even managed hysterical laughter half an hour ago, so he must be on the mend.
</p>
<p>
I have an ulser on my tongue. However I will carry on being super mum.
</p>
<p>
The admin assistant said he wasn't feeling great. Not sure why he mentioned that though. 
</p>
<p>
I have resigned myself to accepting that Problem and her family may never leave.

<strong>15th Jul 2007</strong>
<p>
The evidence to prove that they still linger was found this morning: a poo in the tennis court.
This was not a dog, a cat or a fox poo, but a J poo. With a very distinctive odour.
</p>
<p>
If I find a Weevseywoo poo then the evidence is conclusive. Her poos are very
easy to find. In fact they leap out at you.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>14th Jul 2007</strong>
<p>
Just saw J. Over there, in the field by the lake. 
</p>
<p>
Then I'm sure I say Weevsywoo as well. In the western reach,
chasing rabbits.
</p>
<p>
This is all too much. Have they gone or not? 
</p>
<p>
If not, where are they staying? If they have gone, then why am I 
hallucinating? Aaaaaaaaaah...
</p>
<hr>
<strong>13th Jul 2007</strong>
<p>
I have dreams about them. Weevdiewoo throws Pashee out the window. Then, J throws Kaelan out!
</p>
<p>
They are still here. I can sense it.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps it is that day of the month. EEK! It is the thirteenth.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>12th Jul 2007</strong>
<p>
They are trying to trick me. I think they have gone, I have not seen them all day, but it is all an illusion. 
I expect to see them tomorrow,
falling and fiddling with my TV. Will they ever leave?
</p>
<hr>
<strong>11th Jul 2007</strong>
<p>
They are still here!! They went to a show last night, Joseph and his Multi Coloured Wotsit. I cannot believe it.
They must have left a window open and crept back in when I was asleep.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>10th Jul 2007</strong>
<p>
They have left. They left a few hours ago and have not came back. Obviously gone home. Time for me to go to bed
and sleep safely.

Weenveywoo fell in the pond today. Oh what a palavar. Apparently she gets it from her Grand-Dad. He 
has fallen in to ponds all over the world. Most spectacularly in London when visiting Problem Polly's 
husband's parents. I think this line of hobbits must have an inner ear problem. Their balance is 
atrocious. She can hardly stand for 10 minutes without falling down.
</p>
<p>
Went to the Derby Arms today for Sunday lunch. I paid for everyone, of course. I do not think this line of 
hobbits dip into their purses at all.

Amazingly, Polly did not moan as much today. We went Chessington World of Adventures. The kids loved it
but not as much as Lee and the admin assistant. They were running from ride to ride like ten year olds.
I was suitably embarrassed as one could expect. Everyone really enjoyed the water shute, especially 
when J got soaked. Hahahaha. Weeveywoo screamed when we came to the big drop. Though luckily she
did not pee herself.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>6th Jul 2007</strong>
<p>
Eegads. Problem Polly has arrived. Brought her husband of sorts with her as well as their off-spring.
</p>
<p>
Problems, problems, problems abound when Polly is around. She can find fault with anything and everything.
We had to move the children's bed on numerous occaisions until she was satisfied where they slept.
</p>
<p>
Why do I allow this to happen to me.

The tennis court is definitely the most used feature here at the farm. KDC&S were even
playing in the rain yesterday! SOF made enthusiastic gestures towards the notion but 
did not enter the arena. Typical.
</p>
<p>
Nero is in trouble. K brought Rocky, a beautiful little cocker spaniel to meet the boys. However
Mr Nero reverted to his younger days of being rather bruteful to all new-comers and of course Ruuskii had 
to join the fray. Luckily the fracas was broken up before any damage was done. Rocky then enjoyed
the garden and attempted to make the inside of the house resemble the garden as best he could.
</p>

Other news: the Dubai scottish couple have given birth! To a young lad. I received photos yesterday.
The baby was sleeping (much like his dad after a beer). Spose I'll have to go and visit them now.
</p>
<p>
Most importantly: Kaelan had some cereal today!

More visitors arriving at the farm today. What does it take to get some peace around here?
</p>
<hr>
<strong>29th Jun 2007</strong>
<p>
Kaelan has started dribbling at the mouth quite profusely. Am tempted to take him to the doctor.
I mean, what can one do with all that dribble?
</p>
<p>
I suspect milk is no longer satisfying him. 4 months is the perfect time to wean him.
Till the 6th July...
</p>
<p>
And here is a list of Kealan's <a href="../../countries/kaelan.php">countries</a>, so far..
</p>
<hr>
<strong>27th Jun 2007</strong>
<p>
Kaelan sings to me. He is very good.
</p>
<p>
Montenegro reminds me of Oman. Very dramatic mountains. It amuses Kalean as well.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>26th Jun 2007</strong>
<p>
Going to Montenegro tomorrow. Back on Thursday. Don't miss me (and Kaelan) too much!!!

All at the Epsom farm are recouperating today.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>23rd Jun 2007</strong>
<p>
Like a zoo here today in Epsom. So many wild animals you wouldn't believe it.
L from L brought her family from L. Really, I thought Rocky an co were undisciplined but L's
entourage were a few levels above... Anyway, it looked as though they werer having fun. 
They lost 20+ tennis balls.
Will have to send them a bill. Quality tennis balls are not cheap you know!!
</p>
<p>
Had an take-away indian for dinner. Needless to say I insisted we eat outside. I'm surprised 
to say L was the messiest eater. Even her three year old spilt less than her. Tut tut.
</p>
<p>
S&J wept quite a lot. 
</p>
<p>
 Thankfully, Kaelan slept quite a lot.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>21st Jun 2007</strong>
<p>
Took Kaelan to baby massage today! He enjoyed it enormously. He loved being naked amoungst all those 
other babies and managed to break the all-comers record. Pee'd 4 times!!
</p>
<p>
L from L is coming to the farm on Saturday.
<p>

<strong>20th Jun 2007</strong>
<p>
Yipee!! Happy birthday to me!!
</p>
<p>
4 trucks from Royal Mail have just turned up. They have been hiding my presents and cards from me and
keeping them for today, bless. So, it will take me a week to open them all. And I will know if you haven't sent
me anything! However, I am not impartial to belated pressies so get em in the post!
</p>
<hr>
<strong>18th Jun 2007</strong>
<p>
As you know it is my birthday on the 20th. The address is The Farm, Epsom. Just make sure
your cards and presents get here on time.
</p>
<p>
Have booked Kaelan into Aqua Tots and Caterpillar music. Both are once a week. 
We are looking forward to the fun.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>17th Jun 2007</strong>
<p>
The admin assistant has been wittering on about a special day, all day! Wish he'd shut up.
</p>
<p>
I relate to Paul Potts enourmously. Most of my talents lie waiting for the day that they 
will be discovered. Problem is I have too many of them and not enough days!
</p>
<p>
Amazing me.
</p>

They have returned back to Hobawick today. You know, I think I may even miss them.

<a href="../../contact/">Comment</a> by SID FROM HOBAWICK:- 
My mitts are blistered. I have been worked to the BONE! 
</p>
<hr>
<strong>15th Jun 2007</strong>
<p>
Sid
changed Kaelan's nappy tonight. And he took Kaelan out in his pram when he was restless.
<p>
</p>
Its amazing what a good telling off will do!
</p>
<hr>
<strong>14th Jun 2007</strong>
<p>
Sid, Sid, Sid! You must pull your finger out. You lazy toad. Sid refuses to 
change Kaelan's nappy. Joseph and Eve did a better job of looking after him.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>13th Jun 2007</strong>
<p>
The UK government health visitor official came round today for her first visit. 
She was most impressed with Kaelan (and me).
Said I should carry on doing as I am doing. Wow, she is clever, what did she expect me to do?
Do what she wanted? Idiot.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>12th Jun 2007</strong>
<p>
Frando, Frando, Frando! They are up here you silly moo.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>11th Jun 2007</strong>
<p>
Nancy is pulling her weight. Sid is a lazy toad. Nero will squash him. If I ask.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>10th Jun 2007</strong>
<p>
The damn hobbits have arrived. Doh I forgot I did invite them. But you know
when you say something and don't mean it! They took my invite to come and stay anytime literally.
</p>
<p>
Sid has dived into my beer with gusto and Nancy has almost finished her first bottle of wine. And it 
is not even 4pm. 
Pasha has taken flight to the woods... and Ruuski and Nero are cowering underneath the stairs. 
You'd think the hobbits owned the place.
</p>
<p>
I have decided Kaelan may have problems. He seems to like them!
</p>
<p>
Spose I'll have to go to Sainsburys to stock up. Their bellys know no bounds.
Not sure if Sainsburys stock haggis. Ha! What liars, I've just heard them say they forgot to bring
some haggis with them. A likely story. 
</p>
<p>
They have sniffed around the grounds and have suggested they want to photograph the place to 
show their kin hobbits back home. I hope it does not encourage other hobbits to arrive
en masse. I can sense they will come in their hordes once they know how nice Epsom is.
Jesus! Nancy has just come in saying I must email the farm address to Problem Polly! How long 
will it be before she arrives? One day? perhaps a week at most.
</p>
<p>
Is it rude to ask them how long are they here to stay? Or can I ask them to leave without causing
offence after 24 hours?
</p>
<p>
On a positive note, less work for me. I will dispense baby duties to them both. Any complaints and
I will call the police.
</p>
<p>
Here are some stories from the land of the Hobbits: 
Frando and Wee'dith, the siblings of small Sid, were 'Up the Mare' yesterday. 
Frando is another one whose appetite for alcohol cannot be contained by her
miniscule frame. Yesterday, she woke up in the village after going for a walk to sober up. Tut tut.
Wee'Dith and Bobby 'Many' Bellys (Wee'Diths larger half) also enjoy a drink, they tend to
linger where it is free and flowing. As I recall from last year at the Common Riding, I hardly sat down 
when they were around, having to attend to their liquidinal requirements.
Oh, Prof. Anne and Ovid are drunkards as well. It must be a generational/familial thing.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>9th Jun 2007</strong>
<p>
One year ago I was galloping around the race course in Hobawick. How time flies.
Wonder when I will see the Hobbits again. Not too soon hopefully...

Kaelan is in fine health and that is official. I took him for his two
month checkup yesterday and the doctor said he is doing great despite everything (obviously
she meant having the admin assistant as a dad). He is
weighing in at just under 8Kg and by all accounts is holding 
his head well for one so young. Oh and Kaelan is actually three months old
today, I have been so busy, somethings have had to wait. My schedule can be so overwhelming.
</p>
<p>
Other news: ruuskie has a penchant for squirrels. 
Not eating them of course, just chasing them.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>3rd Jun 2007</strong>
<p>
I think the admin assistant was trying to impress me. He beat S&J at tennis and was 
very proud of himself. 2-1 and 6-0 respectively. I didn't raise an eyebrow.
</p>
<p>
Kaelan has worked out that his hands and fingers are for.
He can hold and touch things in a meaningful way. It is quite
amazing watching his development. 
Just hope he doesn't pick up too much from the admin assistant. 
Otherwise his fingers will spend most of their time up his nostrils.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>2nd Jun 2007</strong>
<p>
Saw the Queen today. She was on her way to the Derby in her Rolls. Obviously I didn't go. 
Epsom Downs is not big enough for so much royalty.
</p>
<p>
S&J coming to stay at the farm tonight. I may challenge them to a game of tennis. 
</p>

<p>
Now Nero is a teenager he is getting a bit rebelious.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>26 May 2007</strong>
<p>
Moving house it not easy. It is quite irksome to be honest.
</p>
<p>
hahahaha! Just realised what the admin assistant's witterings were about. It was his birthday on the 23rd!
Doh! So what. Also I do not think I told you, but it was Nero's thirteenth birthday on the 8th May.
Of course I didn't forget His and as always He feasted like a king.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>23 May 2007</strong>
<p>
Early start, moving to the farm in Epsom today. Though I do not expect it
to go smoothly.
</p>
<p>
Oh and the admin assistant is wittering on about a special day. I
do not know what he is talking about.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>22 May 2007</strong>
<p>
Beautiful day today so went to hide park for lunch. Just me and 
Kaelan. Vromantic.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>20 May 2007</strong>
<p>
Me and Kaelan have been re-bonding over the last couple of days.
It really was too much to ask of us to be separated for more than 
a few minutes. He adores me of course, as I do him. He would like
to thank his granny for looking after him though.
</p>
<p>
On a different note, I think it would be good if some little hobbits from Hobawick kept their
own blogs for a change. It can be very time consuming being a mother
and an International Star. Sometimes not enough hours in the day to
keep the blog up-to-date everyday! 
</p>
<hr>
<strong>18 May 2007</strong>
<p>
Here are two <a href="../../imgs/cornetcousins/">photos</a>
of Kaelans cousins. Apparently they had just been to a village in the 
Borders 6 miles from Hawick. Lillisleaf. Their shoulders must've been sore.
</p>
<p>
I have not seen K for two days and he is with a madwoman!! 
What have I done!!
</p>
<hr>
<strong>17 May 2007</strong>
<p>
Hope baby Kaelan is ok with Nana Nancy. He seemed to get on with her
while we were up to Scotland. But I know how these punks can change. v.Dangerous animals
you know! She does seem to have a good heart though...
</p>
<hr>
<strong>16 May 2007</strong>
<p>
Aunty Kazzy left today, to go back to Malta. It was fantastic to see her again.
After so many years. Hope she makes an effort to travel in the future, for Kaelan's sake!
Surprisingly I cannot remember her guzzle Stilton like it was going out of fashion. And I think she
should stop lying about my bowel habits when I was a child. I did not 
shit in the bath and she did not have to 
wipe my ass all the way up to when I was eleven years old! She is another delusionalist.
</p>
<p>
Nana Nancy arrived today. To replace Kazzy. I am going on hols to Estonia
for a day or two.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>15 May 2007</strong>
<p>
Aunty Kazzy tried to use the computer today. I hadn't noticed her smoking
beforehand,
but I'm sure she must have had something. She had terrible 
trouble controlling the mouse and keyboard.
And using Google was a veritable adventure!! 
She tried to say it was her age that was giving her motor problems
but I think we know otherwise.
Anyway, she seems harmless enough when she's in an altered state.
</p>
<p>
How could I forget to tell you? Nero is living in Orpington! Yes, he is out of the
kennels (he wasn't enjoying it very much) and is living with a foster family for
a couple of weeks until we all move into the Farm in Epsom. Can't wait to
get the boys where they belong, next to their mummy.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>14 May 2007</strong>
<p>
Kaelan met his Aunty Kazzy today. She turned up yesterday looking 
for somewhere to stay while she's visiting London. I couldn't turn her away.
Anyway, Kaelan seems to like her and she has shown a very surprising
mothering instinct, one that I didn't know existed. Though I am unsure what she 
will be like once her drugs have worn off.
</p>
<p>
You know, my sister can really say the most damning things. She said Kaelan
looked like the admin assistant. I will NOT listen to such things. 
She saw the anger in my eyes and tried to retract,
but I will not forget what she said. Till the day I die.
</p>

<strong>13 May 2007</strong>
<p>
The general consensus in Europe of the Song Contest 
result seems to echo mine of yesterday. 
</p>
<p>
Surprisingly some of you think Verka was a man. Please.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>12 May 2007</strong>
<p>
Doh! Sore. Just did a 50+ mile sponsored walk. Raised quite a few $, the most of anyone 
that took park. Quite a few old codgers turned up. Surprised they finished.
</p>
<p>
What is the state of Europe when some Serbian dyke wins THE Song Contest?
Verka was much better. She had a real toe tapping tune.
Scoosh deserved more points.
</p>
<p>
To those of you who have asked: I really do not know where I get the inspiration for
my poems from. It is heaven sent. And thank you all for the praise.

<code style="color: #666666;">
Oh Orpington sweet Orpington,
How I long to be with thee.
Dubai, New York or Hong Kong,
Cannot compare to (the borough of) Bromley.

Oh the roads that I have travelled,
Are many, near and far.
And the cities I have wandered,
Shine nothing like your star.

In the summer and the winter time,
When the seasons play.
All South London is dirt and crime,
But Orpington is so gay!

So Stay!

Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
Why do the people leave?
Coz of Sal and Jo perhaps?
But (honest) they do not (generally) thieve!

If I raise my finger,
It's not to warn the rest!
But to say Orpy is my homeland.
My pinky says it best.

Oh the people of this place,
That live in holy Ramsden.
Are the height of our splendid race,
Not like that (stupid) Lumsden.
</pre>
<hr>
<strong>06 May 2007</strong>
<p>
Oh the agony and the ecstasy of visiting Orpington. How things 
have changed since my years living there. Orpington was once great but now
is a mere husk of its former self. Perhaps I should move back to invigorate
its soul again...
</p>
<p>
My first stop was to S&J's house. 
They were happy to see me of course but Kaelan found it all too much. I think
waking up in Orpington almost scared his wits clean
off! He cried for a good 10 minutes. They then 
offered us some soup gruel which 
I pretended to eat but politely declined on behalf of Kaelan. 
Luckily, S produced a raspberry and strawberry trifle for pudding which 
could've won and award, in my opinion.
Afterwards they showed me the remnants of their once great
garden. Now, a veritable bomb site. How things go to rack and ruin without an
honest influence. I promise to visit them more often, to lift them out 
of this horticultural hell. They also showed me what they claimed to be
a fox den. But where were the foxes? We sat waiting for hours on a chilly english spring day, 
Kaelan freezing
his tiny b*ll*cks off and saw nothing. Delusional tendencies are often found
in this type of people.
</p>
<p>
Then onto L&D's. Things here were a tad better but they dress their 
offspring in a 70's style garb! 
Some Lena Lovich influence going on. 
I really think my sense of fashion could be appreciated in this household.
They also tried to pass off some lesser white sparkling wine as bubbly! Oh
it does not surprise me either. 
Kaelan took to them though. He seemed to communicate well with the offspring, I think 
they could speak Kaelans language. One of them even fed Kaelan his milk with a level
expertise not often found in one so young.
What was really astounding was how they have 
trained their dog 'Rocky' to mount all and sundry. Poor thing, he really was 
adorable but slightly out of control. Though he did provide the experience which
could be described as the only
'ecstasy' of my visit to Orpington!
Mother L turned up at L&D's. I think her arrival was meant to be a surprise but
I nearly died having to see her so soon after our recent meeting.
</p>
<p>
Realistically, I could be such a boon to Orpington. The town needs my guidance again.
It is so frustrating,
I gave so much when I lived there previously. But my influence has waned.
I have so much work to do.
</p>
<p>
Importantly, I can feel a poem about my feelings of loss for Orpington brewing. Perhaps
it will surface tomorrow.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>05 May 2007</strong>
<p>
Going to Orpington today!! Yipee, returning to Kaelan's <i>real</i> roots.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>04 May 2007</strong>
<p>
The admin assistant has managed to find a second job.
I really do not know why people would want to employ him. He is going to work
in Chessington for a company that I am sure will collapse in 
a few months.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>03 May 2007</strong>
<p>
Went to British Museum today. Most enlightening. Though I am sure they
have many of their facts wrong. May have to enlighten them...
</p>
<hr>
<strong>02 May 2007</strong>
<p>
Having L and Waspee round for dinner tonight. Have concocted a 
fantastic trout surprise for them.
</p>
<p>
L is one of those mothers who bored me senseless in the past but 
I am sure will be of more interest now.
</p>
<p>
Waspee is a friend of the admin assistant's. Now that is surprising.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>01 May 2007</strong>
<p>
Happy Birthday Tiger!!
</p>
<p>
I suspect I have made a big mistake today. I have left Kaelan 
with the admin assistant ALL day while I visit places to live 
in London.  I expect he will have cried for the full duration and be exhausted
by the time I return back.
Kaelan will be fine of course.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>30 Apr 2007</strong>
<p>
Driving back to London today. Visiting LZ and her family in
Long Buckly.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>29 Apr 2007</strong>
<p>
10am: 'Eve the Beautiful' is having her sixth birthday party today. Kaelan is invited.
</p>
<p>
8pm: The party was quite an event. All the local glitterati were there in all their 
finery. Eve was the most spectacular of course. They really know how to throw a 
party up here... It really isn't true what they say about 
the Northern People being overly cautious
with their generosity. The egg sandwiches were flowing like champagne at Ascot!!
</p>
<p>
I think Polly's girlfriend Lee, is actually a male! One of those cross dressers!
</p>
<p>
Last day in Scotland today, may pass through Newhobbiton on the way down
to civilisation tomorrow, though it is unlikely. Quite a journey ahead and
with the admin assistant at the helm, not a pleasant experience.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>28 Apr 2007</strong>
<p>
Went to see a possible castle purchase today: Fat Lips near Denhobbiton. Took Pollys 
offspring for a gander, I think they enjoyed it, though the castle was a bit scarey for them
(though they both denied this profusely afterwards). It is 
in a bit of a state. The roof has been blown away over the years and quite a bit of 
delapidation has set in. I think the owner should be quite happy to give the
thing away.
</p>
<p>
Encountered some strange Fauna and Flora of the borders in
the surrounding countryside of Fat Lips:
a glove plant and a sock snake! They were living quite happily in the undergrowth.
</p>
<p>
Afterwards, Prof. Anne turned up at Sid's house. 
She brought what seems to be a student of hers along: Ovid. Unfortunately
the language divide didn't allow me to understand what he was saying, though his splutterings did
seem remotely poetic. I questioned Prof. Anne further about her academic writings where upon she produced a
scrumpled up piece of paper and handed it to me with a significant amount of pride.
I struggled to understand what was scribbled on it but I'm sure the words Frosties, Milk and Lager were
decipherable. You know, I think it was a shopping list.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>27 Apr 2007</strong>
<p>
8am: Today we are going to see Kaelans great grand mother. 
</p>
<p>
8pm: Interestingly, Kaelan seems to
like his Scottish relatives since he was very happy to see his only surviving great
grand parent and she was very happy to see him. Also, interestingly,
the concept of 'numbers' does seem to have existed up here at some point in the past. I heard the mother
of Nancy say 'one, two, three' (more like 'yin, twae, thry') to Kaelan.
</p>
<p>
Wee'Dith (aka 'Edith the Wee' (note: wee as in small)) also managed to make an appearance. She didn't even
apoligise for being late though. However, Kaelan was very happy to see her.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>26 Apr 2007</strong>
<p>
8am: Admin assistant is going to take me for a drive today...
</p>
<p>
8pm: We have ended up in Scotland!! Admin assistant says he got lost. Idiot.
</p>
<p>
However, I have not seen so many happy hobbits in all my life (we've ended up where
the the admin assistants family herald from). Sid and Nancy are over the moon, as is
Problem Polly and her offspring 
(I think Polly has a girlfriend, she seems vfriendly with a hobbit called Lee). 
There is quite a housefull at the moment. Frando has turned up with 
Jimbo and their grand children (Frando is the chirpy little sister of Sid). However, Sids other sister
Wee'Dith hasn't turned up. She obviously doesn't realise Kaelan's importance.
Perhaps Wee'Dith could bring a family tree round to explain the Kaelans heritage to him at some point.
</p>
<p>
Most surprisingly there is a professor in the family! Prof. Anne has arrived with her offspring. 
Though I am unsure of which disipline she is a professor of. And when questioned she cannot 
provide a cohesive answer. She speaks in the tongue of these hobbits and my interpretation team
are not here, so her witterings remain undecipherable.  I look forward to reading one of her 
papers though!
</p>

<strong>25 Apr 2007</strong>
<p>
Hardwork this moving country with a baby in tow business. Think I have found a house though.
It is in Epsom (2 mins from the course), it has its own paddock and stables, big enough
for 2 horses. There is a full size all-weather tennis court. A water feature
with various aquatic life forms. Fantastic views over surrey. A wood for Nero to
run in. Oh so many features. I haven't even started on the house yet.
I have put an offer in and will have to see what the landlord says. I'd 
be very surprised if he weren't vhonoured to have me living in his house.
Some landlords can be very funny when it comes to animals though.
</p>
<p>
Kaelan has made remarkable progress when it comes to holding his head. Less than
2 weeks ago the planet earth had more control of it than he did. Now 
however, he can hold his head for minutes on end and even follow things from left
to right. Its pretty amazing how he is developing.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>21 Apr 2007</strong>
<p>
Zoo today. Kaelan slept through most of it but I really believe his mind is a little better off
for the visit. Toucans were especially spectacular as were the African hunting dogs. Owls 
were very beautiful. Some big beasts were doing things that children perhaps should not have 
been able to view but I suppose that is the nature of nature.
</p>
<p>
Didn't see any rhinos though, or elephants or hippos for that matter.
</p>
<p>
Afterwards had a walk up to the top of Primrose Hill. Very lovely views of London
from up there. Then walked back to Wigmore St through Regents Park.
</p>
<p>
A most pleasant day.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>20 Apr 2007</strong>
<p>
Had a walk round the centre of London today. Went to Trafalgar Square, The Strand, Baker St
etc... Think Kaelan enjoyed it. The admin assistants contribution was to take us to a computer 
book shop.
</p>
<p>
Going to the zoo tomorrow! My idea of course.
</p>

<p>
Constipation does not bring the best out of babies. I know that now.
</p>
<p>
However, Kaelan is perfect (like Nero), therefore his poo is perfect too.
</p>
<p>
We are in London now, we arrived safe and sound last night. K is a little unsure of 
the temperature difference and the lack of dromedaries but otherwise is adjusting well.
</p>
<p>
Have been to Hyde Park and Marks and Spencers today. He enjoyed both!
</p>
<p>
And THANKYOU for turning out in your thousands at Heathrow. It truly was remarkable
how many of you made the effort to meet me. Though I am unsure why so many of you were carrying 
suitcases?
</p>
<hr>
<strong>18 Apr 2007</strong>
<p>
Kaelan has constipation.
</p>
<p>
Nero held up the boys departure by having diarrhea.
</p>
<p>
Shit happens I suppose.
</p>
<p>
Next correspondence from the UK. Limousine should arrive in a couple of hours 
to take us from the Grosvenor House Hotel to the Aeroport. Fingers crossed! 
</p>

<strong>17 Apr 2007</strong>
<p>
Fourth day of packing. They are now starting to load the
40 foot container parked in the front garden.
</p>
<p>
The flight issue has still not been resolved. I do not have a good feeling 
about it all.
</p>
<p>
4pm Well, the flight fiaso has been fixed. I hope. So tommorow, all of you in the UK
that didn't make it out to Dubai will get to see me again. Lucky things.
</p>
<p>
It was very emotional saying goodbye to Pushpa. She was very sad and cried a lot.
My stiff upper lip did waver a bit, I must admit.
</p>

I also feel sad since it is the end of Kaelans first little chapter. No
doubt he will come to Dubai again but the circumstances of his next arrival here will be 
much different, I suspect.

3rd day of packing.
</p>
<p>
Looks like we may be staying in Dubai for a bit longer. Thomas Cook have
cancelled our flights for no reason. I phoned today to find out where 
our tickets were only to be told the tickets had been cancelled. By whom, when and why? 
They could not answer. Am awaiting for news. BTW the flights were scheduled for
Wednesday at 2:15pm Dubai time. I will let you know what happens as events
unfold. I know many
of you are making your way to the aeroport already, to wave me off. 
Similarily for those of you attending in London. I will
expect you there, even if it rains. 
</p>
<p>
Mr Nero, Mr Pasha and Mr Ruuskii are commencing their journey today. I
hope they are all ok. It must be quite stressful for them. Poor things.
</p>
<p>
Oh and Kaelan has not been officially christened. Some of you were upset
that you had not been invited to yesterdays event. Nero is next to godliness
and probably surpasses the "real" thing but he hasn't done the priest course.
So he isn't really qualified. Though realistically if he is holier than God
surely he could do a christening?

Kaelan will only have 2 cousins. Are <i>they</i> looking forward to seeing another one?
</p>
<p>
Admin assistant still limps. Though lessfully.

The admin assistant says running after the taxi barefoot shows how commited he 
is to his family. He says he sacrificed his soul(s) for the good of Kaelan.
</p>
<p>
I tend to ignore this stupdity.
</p>
<p>
On to more important matters: Kaelan was at the doctors for a routine check-up while 
the admin assistant was loosing our official documents. Kaelan is progressing well,
he is 5.9KG which is 12.98lbs in old money. His other vital statistics are improving
in accordance. Length, head circumferance etc.. are all going in the right direction.
He is so unlike his father.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>10 Apr 2007</strong>
<p>
The admin assistant nearly did not make it through today. 
</p>
<p>
I sent him on a simple errand to pick up Kaelans passport from the British
Embassy, when on returning he inadvertantly left Kaelans passport, my passport and his passport;
Kaelans birth certificate, my birth certificate and his birth certificate 
in the taxi that was ferrying him about. Luckily he realised his stupidity and ran after it before
his life was seriously no longer worth living.  
</p>
<p>
In an effort to run faster he kicked off his sandals and ran down the road barefoot. Which now 
leaves him in the humorous situation of limping everywhere he goes. The blisters on his feet are similar
to burns. In fact you could say he has 75% burns on his feet. Hahaha!
</p>
<p>
Idiot.

Going to buy some ear muffs for Kaelan. He will wear them when we go on
holiday to colder climes. Like Iceland, Canada or The Antartic. He will
also wear them when we go to see his "family" in Scotland. I will not 
allow him to hear the language of the Hobbits for fear it may hinder 
his development.
</p>
<p>
Other news: the admin assitant finished work at his second job today, in preperation
for returning to the UK. I could
not believe some of the remarks his work colleagues had written on his leaving card. They 
seemed appreciative of him! Obviously idiots.

<p>
Received an email the other day but couldn't work out who it was from... it
was written in such gibberish that I wasn't sure if it was a virus. 
However I forwarded it to my translation team and 
after much hard work they managed to decipher it.
They say it comes from Frando Hobbit;
Sid Hobbits sister.
</p>
<p>
Frando Hobbit was wittering on about a "grand concert" in a "hut". I mean
whats that all about? Can't they afford Concert Halls up there?
The rest of the email was of little interest
so just to make sure it wouldn't harm my computer I have deleted 
it and advised the translation team to follow suite.

<p>
I have been to the place where these hobbits live and 
realistically, I think the whole town needs English lessons.

The "family" are no longer in the house. 
The holiday has ended and their flight left Dubai this morning .The
house is not the same without them. I am missing them terribly. Baby Kaelan
has been very upset, not being able to see his Nana and Grand Dad. We look
forward to seeing them soon...
</p>
<p>
You wot? Hahahaha! April Fool!! Hehe. Oh the smell has lifted and I am no longer 
in fear of Kaelans life. What a relief. I have checked my jewellery and 
everything seems in order. Will have to go through the family silver and best china this 
evening.

<p>
<code style="color: #666666;">
Wow!!  The 10pm feed last night was out of this world! Not quite sure 
what they did different but it gave me the giggles. I went to bed 
feeling happy for the first time in weeks. They thought they were 
going to get to sleep through the night but little did they know 
that I still had my alarm set for 2am! So I had a feed at 2am and 
so as to not give them a false sense of security I woke up at 4.30am as well.  
It's quite a good game.

</p>
<p>
<code style="color: #666666;">
This morning it was Granny's Birthday and I had my first taste of 
sparkling wine, which actually, was quite nice.  I much prefer 
that in my bottle than the stuff they call milk.  Don't know if 
Mummy had too much to drink this afternoon, but she left me on the sofa, 
turned her back for a second and I threw myself off onto the floor - 
wow, did she feel bad.  Everyone fussed me for quite some time.  
Although I am fine - I did lap up all the attention.
</code>
</p>
<p>
<code style="color: #666666;">
It's been so good having so many people around me for the past few weeks.  
I don't know why they keep calling my Granny, Nana Nazgul or why Grandad 
seems to be called Sid Hobbit.  I think it's very unfair.  
Also I love my Aunty Pauline (not Polly as they call her!).  
I can't wait to meet my cousins Joseph and Eve.  They sound 
like they will be great fun when I visit Hawick, Scotland, my homeland.

</p>

My baby is growing fast. Tonight he is on his first solids! I jest not.
Milk is not satisfying his hunger so the maternity team decided it would be 
best to break up a Farleys Rusk into his milk. 
</p>
<p>
Other news: Nana Nazgul is 60 tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
I have heard reports that many of you fell off your chairs yesterday
after reading that the family claim to be working hard. We all know that they 
are as close to being bone idle as can be. I hope your bruises heal soon.

<strong>26 Mar 2007</strong>
<p>
For the advancement of inter-family relationships I am allowing the Scottish visitors (aka the "family")
to write a "postcard" home. However, for the sake of clarity I had to give their efforts 
to the Hawick/English interpreter. Otherwise, I assure you, their utterings would be 
sheer gobbledygook:
</p>
<code style="color: #666666;">
Can you believe it - we've been allowed to send a postcard home by means 
of 'Madame' Astrid's blog!  That's because they are not letting us 
get out of this smelly house.  They are trying to blame us for the smell - 
though if the truth were known, it's their room that now smells!  
We think instead of disposing of Kaelan's used nappies into the bin, 
they are saving them all and storing them under their bed!
If we were to guess who the father of their offspring is - we would 
have to say Pasha as Kaelan has a definite 'meow' when hungry!  
Admin assistant still claims that it is he.
For those of you who do not know - Madame and admin assistant have 
a resident maid, Pushpa, and a resident maternity nurse, Karen, 
a gardener and now Grandad, Granny and Aunty Pauline have been 
added to the ranks.  How many people are needed to make them feel above 
us all!!  We've never worked so hard in our lives before!  
Whilst they were not looking, we sneaked a look out of the window 
and saw that Dubai is a huge building site - bigger than Hillcrest View!
Finally, a personal message for Joseph and Eve.  
Honestly, we are fine (though hard worked) and really can't 
wait to get back to the smaller building site we call home.  
Looking forward to seeing you both soon 
(if they agree to let us go! - only joking!)

Normally I would NOT allow such prose to on my web site but I realise Kaelan
may want to have contact with his "other side" later on in life.

Sid Hobbit and Nancy Nazgul renegaded on their offspring today. 
As mentioned previously, there has been 
an odour lingering in the house since the "family" arrived. Initially
I thought it was haggis, but today I realised it was the smell of shit
that has been propogating through my house. I confronted them
as soon as I had cleaned up my own vomit (my stomach spasmed as the 
truth dawned). The parents had no qualms and led me to their offspring's room. 
Polly demonstrated most strongly but the evidence was undeniably
there. The stench was abhorrant! I have no idea what she has been eating
but the loo was blocked solid. It was like concrete. I suspect it has something
to do with the porridge she eats 4 times a day.
</p>
<p>
My garden is a wreck. My maintanence team had to rip up the lawn
to get to the blockage. 
What's more, two of them had to be taken to hospital! Noxious fumes almost put an end to 
their wretched lives.
You should have seen the gassy grizzle in the pipes. I swear it was writhing.
I really do not know what to do.
I must ask them to leave. Problem Polly at least.
</p>
<p>
Oh dear. I am permanently shaking and have been for the last 24 hours.
</p>
<p>
I must get Kaelan to safety.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>24 Mar 2007</strong>
<p>
Received an invite to go to the Burj al Arab today. You know, one of 
the world's most extravagant hotels. The "family" insisted coming along
so I felt obliged to take them.
</p>
<p>
I thought Sid Hobbit was going to wet his pants as he walked into the
lobby. He was very impressed. Nancy and Polly pretended to be 
royalty but it really cannot be feigned. I was overwhelmingly embarrassed.
</p>
<p>
Oh and to make matters worse, they started flashing their cameras
around. So much like tourists it made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end.
</p>
<p>
On the 24th floor, once we entered the hotel room,
they started shrieking in their Scottish gibberish so
I have no idea what they were trying to say but the drool on the floor gave an indicator.
To cut a long story short I nearly had to call security to stop them
from stealing the hotel furnishings. I very rarely get angry with 
animals but today they pushed me a tad too far.
</p>
<p>
Unsurprisingly, Kaelan took to the plush surroundings with the 
grace one would expect from a proper relation of mine. He was quite unphased by the
luxurious surroundings and the histrionics of his lessers.
</p>
<p>
Also went to Arabian Ranches. Kaelan met his first horses. 
Seemed to like them, and them he. 
An 'Ahlan' photographer was there of course ('Ahlan' means 'Hello' in Arabic). 
See the photos <a href="../imgs/burjalarab/">here</a>.
</p>

<strong>23 Mar 2007</strong>
<p>
Going to Fujairah today with the "family". Though leaving Kaelan behind.
He will have to learn to fend for himself at some point.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>22 Mar 2007</strong>
<p>
It is hard to change an opinion that is very obviously correct.
</p>
<p>
Kaelan looks fabulous at the moment. That is blatantly fact.
</p>
<p>
The Sid hobbit grows sturdier each day. That is immutable.
</p>
<p>
Nancy has rounded a corner. That is most definitely undeniable. 
Especially for those you who have known her... and are still alive.
</p>
<p>
The offspring... what can one say about the offspring? Good offspring? Perhaps 
that is perceptive, but not difficultly so.
</p>
<p>
Ahh.... Kaelan is so lucky.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>21 Mar 2007</strong>
<p>
WHAT!! The interpreter said the grandparents and offspring plan to stay two weeks?
Think I may go on holiday, take Kaelan to safety.
Kaelan does seem to like them though and they are changing the nappies. 
Perhaps I should rethink my opinion of them....
</p>
<p>
Also, this motherhood thing is changing me. I sometimes get really worried 
that some harm will come to Kaelan. Or that I will do something not 100% for the best.
I didn't feel quite the same for Nero and Pasha. I just sort of knew they'd be ok.
</p>
<p>
The admin assistant says I'm doing a great job. What qualifies him to say that precisely?
Its amazing he could partake in making something as lovely as Kaelan. Think the DNA
tests must've been wrong. 
</p>
<hr>
<strong>20 Mar 2007</strong>
<p>
Kaelan has outgrown his first bodysuit! I tried to put one on him that fitted aok last week.
He screamed somewhat as I tried to squeeze it over his head, but I managed! His ears were red
but unharmed.
</p>
<p>
Also, I have organised a translator. He will be here tomorrow. Finally I will be able to 
communicate with Sid, Nancy and Polly.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>19 Mar 2007</strong>
<p>
Oh, the smell of haggis is unbearable. Don't they wash? Can you believe three of them arrived!!
It's only for a couple of days though. 
</p>
<p>
Luckily baby Kaelan is oblivious to their odour. The grandparents 
seem happy to see him though. They are privileged indeed. Their off-spring, and the 
admin assistant's sister, arrived unannounced (the Scottish know when they are on to a 
good thing.) 
</p>
<p>
Apparently they think they can help me! However there may be evidence to
prove their claims. The existing grandchildren are lovely. Eve is very beautiful 
(though second to Kaelan, of course) and Joseph is very clever. He is a natural at maths.
Their Mummy would like to say she likes Dubai and with very bad Scottish grammar, "Kaelan is
as very cute as anything".
</p>
<p>
I must admit the grandfather is really hobbit-like! And amazingly the grandmother broke into
a smile when she first saw Kaelan.

<p>
Wow, can he vomit!
However, I now have a maternity nurse and she said it is ok if he vomits like Old Faithful.
Well, not exactly ok but she stopped me from going to the hospital with him.
The first time he did it I thought he had exploded! 
</p>
<p>
Moses was here yesterday, she is an old work mate from Oman. Think I'll invite 
her to be Kaelan's God mother. Apparently Kaelan needs to get christened before he can 
have God parents. Moses is a Muslim, how come she knew that and I didn't?
</p>
<p>
He is growing more beautiful by the day. Just like his mum.
</p>

<p>
Am in the process of getting a birth certificate for Kaelan. Not an 
easy process in a country like the UAE. Very administratively challenged. 
However, the hardest part is convincing the authorities that the admin assistant
is the father. They just laugh.
</p>
<p>
Hope the wrinklies can take the heat. 38 degs today. 
</p>
<hr>
<strong>14 Mar 2007</strong>
<p>
The admin assistant's wrinkleys are arriving on Sunday. They're only here for a day or two 
so I shouldn't get too bored of them. It will be the first time Kaelan will have met relatives
of his other than me! (oh sorry, I forgot about the admin assistant).
I'll warm to them slightly if they bring some good whisky.
</p>
<p>
Kaelan's bellybutton appeared today. Honestly. It was hidden by a clothes line clip thingy.
</p>
<p>
My outie is no longer an outie. That is really bad news. I was having 
so much fun playing with my outie. Goodbye outie. You will be missed....

Day 7: H is coming round tonight. H is from Oman. I think I like Omanis better than Emiratis.
Sheikh bin Wasel and his shiny camels do not have a chance.
Hope H brings some nice Omani dates. 
</p>
<p>
On the subject of food, the admin assistant wants Kaelan to have eaten
some haggis before he is one year old. He thinks it will make Kaelan whole Scottish instead of half. 
I mean, what is he on? To be frank, I'm going to keep this 'whole' Scottish thing quiet.
</p>
<p>
Oh, and did I mention that my baby looks like I expected him to look when he was in my womb? 
He is gorgeous.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>12 Mar 2007</strong>
<p>
Yes, I am breast feeding. (Steady on boys!! Jim especially) 
I think it is good for Kaelan to get his nutrition from his mum though I do not intend to
carry on until his teens, like some mums do. 3 or 4 months is quite sufficient. I did it with
Nero and Pasha, so it only seems fair...
</p>
<p>
My stomach is slowly shrinking. But I still have an outie, all-be-it a bit of a deflated one... 
However, the last outie photos will follow soon. I know you love them.
</p>
<p>
And thankyou for all your wishes of congratulations. It will take me till Kaelan is 18 to read all
the cards, emails ands texts.

<p>
Day 4: We went for the first 'official' check-up since leaving hospital. 
</p>
<p>
I was going to ask the doctor about speech therapy lessons since Kaelan's vocabulary is a
bit limited but I refrained because of the booboo I made with babies and walking. Anyway, good news, 
he has gained 5 &#37; of his body weight (he now weighs 4.2Kg). I was a bit embarrassed though. Once we had taken off
his baby grow and nappy, a fountain of pee shot 3ft in the air. It lasted quite a long time as well.
There was an awkward silence, then thankfully he started crying. I started to discipline him but the doctor 
shook her head and told me to be quiet.
</p>
<p>
I can't seem to get it right. The dentist wouldn't let me get him measured for dentures either.
</p>
<p>
Here are 2 photos of him on day <a href="../imgs/kaelanday4/">four</a>.
</p>
<p>
Under ordinary circumstances I would say someone must have sleeping sickness if they were to sleep as long as 
Kaelan does. However, I will give it another week to see if he gets better. Then I might register him with another doctor.
</p>

<p>
His 3rd day and 2nd Emirate. We went to Abu Dhabi today, to
buy a pram. 
</p>
<p>
Soon after I got Kaelan home I realised Kaelan wasn't able to walk so 
I went to the doctors to complain.
Dr Costa wasn't very happy with me and suggested I buy a pram. How was I to know babies 
don't walk until they are usually at least 1 year old. This whole thing is a learning experience for
me you know.
</p>
<p>
The admin assistant is so smug. He knows he knows more than me about babies, says
he learned it from when his cousins and niece and nephew were small.
Humbug! With my superior intelligence I will know more than him within days...
</p>
<p>
Here are some things I have learned already....
</p>
<p>
.....
</p>
<p>
Oh just give me a week or two.

<p>
He's here!! Kaelan was born on the 06 March 2007 at 10:13am. He weighed in
a 4.078Kg (just under 9lbs) and I was amazing all the way through the labour and
birth.
</p>
<p>
My web team have put up some <a href="../imgs/birthofkaelan/">photos...</a>
</p>
<p>
I went into labour at approx 12am on the 6th and by the time I arrived at hospital (5:30am)
my cervix was 2cm dilated. A mere 30 minutes later it was 5cm!! As you know, I do
not like to hang about. However, I realised I was  putting the 
hospital staff under too much pressure so I decided to make it easier for them. 
It took a few more hours for full dilation.
Finally at 10am 
Kaelan was knocking on the door. I had a breather and then with one almighty push, he was out. Luckily the staff caught him
as he was jettisoned, otherwise he was heading towards Abu Dhabi at a tremendous rate of knots and may even 
have overshot the mark and ended up in Saudi Arabia.
</p>
<p>
Pain? Bah, nothing of the sort. Women are such wooses. I was hardcore. Didn't take a thing.
And even though he was a blue/purple colour when he popped out,
it was a beautiful hue, didn't scare me one bit.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, how do I feel about being a parent? It feels good. For the first time in my life the 
sound of a crying baby sounds beautiful. 
I am proud of me but also touched by the miracle of generating new life.
This new little soul has shone a new light on my comprehension of the world.
Now, for the first time, I know there is someone other than me. That is the real miracle of Kaelan's birth.
</p>

How did the admin assistant fair in all this? 2/10. He managed to get a speeding ticket on the 
way to the hospital. Only 1!! He truly does not care. If I had been able to drive, it would
have been like a disco down Sheikh Zayeed Road. Oh and before we left for the hospital,
he managed to have breakfast. Tut tut. No sense of urgency, no understanding of the 
situation. The only one small positive point is that he is fairly good with changing nappies. Where as I smeared
the sh*t all over Kaelan's arse and up round his legs, the admin assistant did manage to
get the tar off with a few deft wipes.

Oh and babies do not have tails, I know that now.

8:00am Going to see Doctor Costa today. Hopefully she will be able to 
determine:
<br><br>
a. if the baby is still in there.<br>
b. where it is if it isn't.<br>
c. how long it will take to come out if it is in there.
</p>
<p>
Do babies have tails? Like tadpoles? I'm sure at school they said something 
about tadpoles. Can't remember where they fit in though. Suppose we'll find out.
</p>
<p>
7pm: Dr Costa looked bemused when I asked my question about the tadpoles. 
I'd even go as far to say she had despair in her eyes.
She said "Think about it!". I said "I have been thinking about it, that's 
why I have a question!". Anyway she wouldn't tell me. So I am unsure whether 
the baby will have a tail or not? Oh and it is in there she assured me.

Hold on? This is a joke. The admin assistant was born on a Sunday.
</p>
<p>
No sign of the baby. Been doing lots of walking and reflexology but nothing working.

Some of you have been putting money on a 3/3 birth date.
Things are not looking good. It is 11am and no signs.
In fact I'm starting to wonder if the baby may be out already.
I mean, there's been no movement today. Is there a 
chance that I could've missed the whole thing? I wonder where it is then?

Praise Alli that your child arrives safely. I hope it
is a boy for my newly born daughter. I have many shiney cars
and lots of camels.
They should marry before the falling of the seventh moon 
in the year of the Browning Date. 
Please consider this offer seriously. Much happiness will befall our 
offspring and our camels on successful completion of our families union.
P.S. Get rid of the admin assistant.

I did actually meet the admin assistants parents once.
Just hope they can do a good job of being Grand-Parents. Can't
remember their names though. I think the father's 
name was Sid. He reminded me of a hobbit. I assume his wifes name
was Nancy. She had a rather strained look.
</p>
<p>
Oh well, history beckons.

The admin assistant is asking how long the baby will take to arrive.
Eh? Whats it got to do with him? He can change nappies, I don't mind that.
But he's not to open his mouth. I don't want the baby picking up his bad
grammar.

I hope the baby isn't too big. In these circumstances small is good. How about 4lbs? I think that
is quite big enough. Nero was tiny when he arrived. He was perfectly healthy and 
probably only weighed in at two or three pounds. I think that is the ideal weight. In fact when 
beelee's kittens were born they were only a couple of ounces each. 
They were perfectly fine. Oh that would be fantastic.

I am officially 37 weeks pregnant today. That is, apparently, a full-term.
I never do things by halves. Nero has been massaging my stomach.
Also been doing Yoga every day in preparation for the birth.
Still deliberating the easy option.

It was freezing this morning. 11&deg;C!! That is cold for Dubai.
I was worried about the baby being chilly. However, I remembered that when things come out from in there, they
often have steam rising from them. So it is probably quite cosy in my tummy.

Went on a bus tour of Dubai yesterday. Very interesting! Must

Some of the new architecture in Dubai could be described as quite outlandish; however 
some buildings are very enchanting.

Some people are too snooty to go on bus tours. S&J?

I am very disgruntled about the State of the Union speech Mr Boosh gave yesterday.

Went for brunch with some friends this brunch-time. They brought
their off-spring. 
They seemed happy enough, though I think it was all a charade.
All it did was eat, sleep and, apparently shit (I did not witness the third activity. Thank ali).

Went to the doctors yesterday. They said I was approximately 32 weeks pregnant.
What? That means I've only got another 20 weeks to go.
</p>
<p>
What was I doing 32 weeks ago? My life is so fast everything is just a blur.
Yes, I think I was in Scotland. But, I mean, there were a few 'occasions' up there.
I just CAN'T remember who with. Will have to get a DNA test done. 
But I don't know any names, oh, I was so drunk.
I think they were all Scottish. Does that mean the baby will be Scottish? 
There's so damn much I don't know. Must start investigating.

This is serious. Going to doctors tomorrow to find out how many weeks I am.
Do they still have immaculate conceptions now-a-days? That is the most likely circumstance.

This is really heavy. I was wondering why I was having so many moving sensations in my stomach.

Oh, and saw a Pharoahs Eagle Owl today. S&J almost wet themselves. 
They started hooting when they saw it. I do not think they understand
