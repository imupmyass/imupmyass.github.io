My translation team managed to unravel a hobbit saying, here it is: "Today people have as many noses as there are days left of the year".
This particular one came from the hobbit called Lydia's husband. I truly believe there is no point trying to study
what these creatures are saying, as can be demonstrated, they speak shit.

The admin assistant defeated the Frando Hobbit at table tennis today! She was not happy and exclaimed language
that even though I could not understand what she was saying I understood what she meant. I thought she was going to have a hissy fit,
at one point she almost threw herself on the floor in a tantrum. Oh these hobbits have no decorum.

Bit warmer today. Snow is starting to go.
<br>
<br>It does upset me but I think Kaelan and Aden like these creatures. They are always giggling and laughing. We went to a "family day" at a local club yesterday. The day was predominantly comprised of playing dominos and drinking. Where I come from, this type of activity is more likely found in an old mans club.
<br>
<br>Frando Hobbit promised us a table tennis tournet later on this week. I am quite looking forward to it.

What a debauched day. The drink started when Frando and Wee'dith came round to Sid n Nancy's house on Christmas morning. To be honest though,
I don't think they had much to drink before they were drunk. "eeraiblootirdefteraglessowinesoeeer" was what they were saying to each
other, what it means, I have no idea.

They have law enforcers here in Hobawick, and perhaps they are made of solid stuff because I was invited to one of their
burrows this evening and I wasn't offered a drink! At least not all of these creatures are debilitated by drink.

I've decided to go to Hobawick. I know if I don't go Sid n Nancy will find me where ever I try to hide.

I have just received the hobbits offer: £200. That is all! Oh, how embarrassing, that is not enough for me to grace their presence over the festive period. I would be hard pushed to give them a 5 minute telephone call on Christmas day for that paltry sum. 
<br>
<br>I do pity them, for I have been told a number of hobbits have already been seen with shovels clearing the A7 of snow for my arrival. Do they really expect me to risk life and limb to be with them?

The hobbits are proposing to pay me to go to Hobawick for Christmas. They have not provided any figures yet, but I doubt they could scrummage up enough hae-pennys to get me much further than the Surrey border!

<br>Kaelan was dressed up as a camel today and Aden as an elf. Aden would not accept he was an elf and insisted was Father Christmas.

Happy Birthday Sidney The Hobbit!! 
<br>
<br>Today Kaelan and Aden met up with Sid n Nancy on Skype. Kaelan asked Sid how old he was, once Sid told Kaelan, Kaelan said "You&#096;ll be dead in a minute!". 
<br>
<br>However, Sidney didn&#096;t die during the Skype call so Kaelan&#096;s prophecy didn&#096;t come true. Unfortunately. No doubt Sid n Nancy will be lingering about wherever it is I am celebrating Christmas. They always find out where I am, even though I do my damnedest to avoid them.

Ahhh December. You all know what happens this month don`t you! Please send presents to England. Thats where I`ll be.
<br>
<br>Last night at 4am I got woken when I heard Kaelan crying outside my bedroom. I went out to the landing without putting the light on started putting him to bed. However when I went into Kaelans bedroom, Kaelan was in bed! I thought who is this impostor beside me! I looked down and it was Aden, oh goodness I thought. He cries like Kaelan now, not like a baby. They used to cry very differently but theres not much difference between them now, in lots of respects. Kaelan is approx 16Kg, Aden 15Kg, and I would suggest their is only an inch difference in height. Aden is starting to come out of nappies but his speech is still not great. Other than that they play with the same toys, watch the same cartoons. A year ago Kaelan was a little boy and Aden was a baby. Now I think I have two little boys.

Aden&#096;s nose is continually subjected to an assault that very few boxers noses would have to go through. Once again he has a giant scab running from his forehead to his top lip, encompassing all of his nose. He acquired it a day or two ago when he flew head-over-heals over the handle bars of a bicycle at school. He is a rough and tumble boy, that is for sure.
<br>
<br>Kaelan is also learning the hard way when it comes to changing his mind, at a whim. Yes,no,yes,no,yes,no. Ok then, I will decide for you. He doesn&#096;t like when I chose for him. But these short sharp lessons have an effect, because no matter how much he moans, cries and complains that what I chose WASN&#096;T what he wanted, I do not change my mind.

Kaelan has started to say he is a 4. 
<br>This is of course a bit premature.
<br>I`ve told him he is three and a half
<br>But he just starts to laugh.
<br>
<br>Your birthday is after Christmas, I say.
<br>He turns and looks with a faceful of dismay:
<br>I am 4, I`ve had my birthday in England and now I am four. Not sure how to explain to him that he is mistaken since after all it is over 4 years since he started developing in my stomach, so feasibly he is 4. Nearer 4 and a half actually.
<br>I say, I know, because you came from my belly.

<br>There, do you like my new poem style? It is called the "standard rhyme with wittering prose" style. A little rhyme, a little prose, then a little witter. I shall continue my creative development tomorrow.

Incidentally, Aden has learned to keep anything edible away from Edo's mouth. If
Edo walks passed when Aden has food in one (or both) of his hands, they swiftly 
make their way to the middle of Aden's back.

Kaelan has been very quiet over the last week. In fact he has been so quiet, I

I will make sure I see him tomorrow at breakfast.

ho-hum. There is a little fibber in the house. Kaelans stories are growing more and more fantastic each day. I think he is watching too many cartoons. His (and Aden`s) latest favourite is the "Octonauts".
<br>See the latest episode here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00vjgv9/Octonauts_The_Lost_Sea_Star/
<br>
<br>Aden is growing up everyday. Though he still can`t speak.
<br>
<br>Both of them have largely stopped sucking their thumbs. In fact, Kaelan may be the elder, but his thumb is the most surreptitious. Only occaisionaly do I now turn a corner and witness it sprint like a frog jumping from a hot frying pan into his pocket.
<br>
<br>Then, when the act has been caught, he starts blaming his thumb! His thumb, according to him, is a sentient-being! "It wasn&#096;t me. It was my thumb!!", he says. 
<br>
<br>I.

<br>I really do not what to say.

From my privileged position as Head Honcho of HSBC Armenia, I perceive a unique and distinct picture of the geo-policital pressures of this region. I mix with the movers and shakers. I meet with the holy and the profane. More importantly, today, I will share with you my insights in to this most complex of landlocked countries:
<br>
<br>1. I am very, very important and special to everyone here.
<br>2. My booboos are special too.
<br>3. However, I think of Surrey all the time.
<br>4. Also, why can`t I buy branflakes at the corner shop?
<br>5. I`m glad the 40C heat of the summer is over.
<br>6. Hope it doesn`t get too cold this winter.
<br>7. When will people abroad stop driving on the wrong side of the road?
<br>8. Not received my invitation to the Royal Palace from the King of Armenia yet. Will have to email him. What`s his address?
<br>
<br>There. You see. What is more important though is why is the admin assistant still here, and does he really have to drink straight out of the juice carton? Damn idiot.

The first snow of the year fell last night. Eh, not in my garden but at over 13,000 feet. Mount Aragats had its small remaining snow fields from last winter replenished with the first fall of the coming winter. Yes, the daytime temperatures in Yerevan may still be touching 30C but on the top of Mt Aragats the short summer is already coming to an end.

Kaelan is developing a bad habit of say "chay" for no and "ha" for yes. Anyone would think he was trying to speak Armenian.

Kaelan makes remarkable observations all the time. 
His latest one came after I remarked that there was some naughty 
litter in the Armenian countryside (unfortunately there is quite a lot flying about). 
Kaelan said "that is ok. coz when the wind blows, it&#096;ll blow the naughty litter into jail". 
You see, that is how the world should be!
<br>
<br>Aden, refuses to speak much more than mumbo jumbo. 
He is at a similar level of spoken language as the admin assitant. 
They are unrelated of course.

My boys do not know when to stop eating. I wish they did. Kaelan yesterday got so stuffed he looked like a Christmas turkey. However, unfortunately the way a lot of that intestinal rubbish was cast out was from his mouth! Perhaps I should not blame Kaelan though. I like these Armenians very much but they do not take "Stop!" as an instruction. They kept on feeding my children after I say don&#096;t give them any more. Eventually one of them had to pop. Kaelan was sick 3 times during night and I have been up since 3am. 
<br>
<br>One plus point is that I danced like a true Armenian.

Here is a report of Aden and Kalean from our holidays to England.
They spend a couple of days with their old child minder in Banstead:
<p />
<pre>           <b>Aden and Kaelan - 21st July 2010</b>
<u>Activities</u>

Sophie and Kaelan played in the garden; they played with 
water; collected apples from the apple tree by climbing   
the climbing frame and then pretended cooking them on the 
pretend fire.

Sophie and Kaelan played with the food and had an indoor 
pretend picnic.

We went to the new Banstead park. Aden loved the swing, 
slide and rope swing. Aden had to be told off 2 times for 
hitting children (his size) - the 2nd time he'd hit a girl 
I told him to say Sorry so he gave her a hug and a kiss!! 
Kaelan wanted to go on the swing but I told him he had to 
wait as there wasn't a free swing. I said why don't you go 
on the slide. Kaelan said "I didn't ask to go on the slide 
I asked to go on the swing!". So I had to tell Kaelan off 
for talking rudely with me(!). At the end when Kaelan had 
had enough of the park he said "I'd like to go in the cafe 
now and have some lunch!".

Kaelan played with the remote control Bullet train from 
Japan.

Mathew was talking to Kaelan during dinner. Kaelan told 
him that he was born in Dubai and that he lives in Armenia. 
He said his mum is called "Asteroid" and his dad is called 
the "admin assistant"!!

<u>Nappy Change</u>

12:15pm - Aden

Kaelan had to use the toilet today as the potty had 
broken this morning (whilst Sophie was using it), he was 
fine using the toilet. Had poo before lunch.

1.15pm - Aden (poo)

<u>Sleep</u>

Aden 10.15 - 10.30 - in car
Aden 10.30 - 12.15 - in cot
Kaelan 3.00 - 4.00 - in pushchair
Aden 3.45 - 4.45 - in pushchair

<u>Lunch</u>

Cheese and tomato pizzas; garlic bread; coleslaw; tomatoes 
and cucumber.

Melon and Strawberries	 Water

<u>Dinner - 5.00pm</u>

Fish fingers; pasta; cucumber; carrots and baked beans

Ice lollies

Water
</pre>
<p />
Aden knows how to say sorry properly, thankfully. 
Kaelan knows I am from out of this world. Lets leave it at that.

Ah, so busy. Back from the New Forest now. Very lovely, I must say. The boys enjoyed seeing the horses and cows roaming around the countryside. The B&B where we stayed had labradoodles! They were very friendly. Went to see some heavy horses. The tour guide asked what we knew about heavy horses. The admin assistant answered "They&#096;re big". What an idiot. The boys went on a couple of cart rides, they drove a tractor and Kaelan did a poo in his pants. That boy! In the house he is impeccable, outside he only does pees in the toilet or grass. His poos make it as far as his pants. He is also starting to suck his thumb again...

Went to see Ruuskii in Orpy yesterday. He was very happy to see us, as can be expected.
<br>
<br>After leaving Ruuskii, I was driving through Orpy to see Rocky, I bumped into S&J. They pleaded with me to have a spot of lunch with them. I reluctantly agreed. As usual their portions were hardly enough to fill mouses belly. 1 strawb each and a pithering half spoon of jam for my scone.
<br>
<br>Eventually I made it to Rocky&#096;s, but he wasn&#096;t there, so had to speak to his flat-mates for a while, until he arrived.

Oh, what a terrible journey from Armenia yesterday. They boys were a bit naughty. Crying and fighting most of the way. I was quite exhausted. Then there is the jet lag, Aden is up today a 3.30am. Luckily the admin assistant is looking after him while I snooze. I am snoozing right now, at 5:30am and I shall be as fresh as a daisy at 8! And I will not understand why the admin is not full of beans and Aden is grumpy because he is ready for his afternoon nap. The same will happen tomorrow, and the day after that, and possibly for a couple of more days after that... I need my sleep.
<br>
<br>5.51am and Kaelan is on the toilet while I continue snoozing. He is giving a running commentary of his progress. "Big poo now! little poo, that was a little poo,... now a fast poo. Peepee has finished. Come, I&#096;ll show you!"

Oh, how I know you are getting excited, my UK fans. I am coming over to blighty tomorrow, Yipee!! For two and a half whole weeks, Yippee!! How much driving can I make the admin assistant do? Ah, let me see, the skys the limit.
<br>
<br>This will be the first holiday where Kaelan will not be in nappys. I am unsure how he will take to pooing at 30k feet.
<br>
<br>Aden will misbehave on the plane as usual, I suspect.

<br>Someone tried to steal my electricity on Wednesday night. Forgot to tell you.

<br>I have found my Christmas present. A solar plane. Please start collecting!
<br>
<br>Still Aden&#096;s main word is "lol". It has been for a month or so. Though he is succussfully saying other words, "lol" is his favourite. If you ask him what lol means, he just smiles.

<br>Happy birthday, mini me.
<br>
<br>Ah, what to do....?

Kaelan made an observation yesterday which is as profound as it is accurate: mummy, you cannot pump because you do not have a willy.
<br>
<br>Aden is having a cute problem with the word yes. He struggles with the sound `s` (much like Kaelan did) and says `yum` instead of &#096;yes&#096;. Do you want to watch a video? Yum. Do you want to.... Yum, Yum, Yum. Everything is yum. Unless it is no. Then everything is Nao. Very similar to a cockney no. Where did he get that from? Noat me, I am poash you know.
<br>
<br>Kaelan did such a big poo on the potty today, it struck his arse with such fervour he needed a bath afterwards. Never a dull moment, you know.
<br>
<br>Aden`s second birthday is soon. Please do NOT forget.

So, I have been on holiday for a week, a few days in Armenia, then off to Georgia:
<a href="../../imgs/2010/06/27/">photos</a>.
Covered over 2,000km in 7 days. Man I love driving. Or should I say, I hope the 
admin assistant does. Idiot.
<p />
I do worry about Kaelan, he is very interested in death and killing at the moment.
"Kill, Kill, Kill".
All Aden can say is "LOL, LOL". Everything is "LOL".

Kaelan, within the last 15 minutes did his first poo on the potty. He asked to go, pointing to his bum. He was a little perturbed, I could tell but when he was sitting, everything went smoothly. I didn&#096;t rush him, of course and when he was finished he stood up, turned around and declared "its a worm poo!". Ah, joys of parenthood. Next up, Aden.

I think the Armenian people are quite unsure what to make of the hobbits. They stand and stare as they walk past. Especially Nancy, they really do not know what to do when she grimaces at them, trying to be friendly. Some run into shops, others escape into passing buses and cars. Soon the street is deserted. 
<br>
<br>As can be expected, the main preoccupation of the hobbits is to consume alcohol. The local wine is quite cheap so they guzzle it up until their belly&#096;s are round and then fall asleep. Oh, I am so frightened that the neighbours will see them in this state and think bad of me, I insist the guards keep the front door tightly locked.
<br>
<br>Today they want to go to a cognac factory. Dare I let them? The aftermath could be quite a mess. Oh dear, what is one to do? 
<br>
<br>Kaelan and Aden have been influenced by the hobbits visit. Aden has started lying on the floor being a puppy and Kaelan has a rather larger belly than usual.

Regarding the photos I posted a couple of days ago, the bottles of coke on what appears to be a market stall are not bottles of coke (although they are coke bottles). They are bottles of geenee, which is Armenian for....wine. Hence the reason the hobbits and the admin assistant are scrabbling to purchase some. They are so uncouth it is nauseating.

Kaelan went to the doctors today. His stomach has been a bit distended and he has been having rather runny poos. The doctor said he was full of wind. I&#096;m not sure what to say to that, apart from he is NOT full of wind.
<br>
<br>
There are a lot of swifts buzzing around at the moment. They are like jet fighters swooping through the air, dog fighting with the insects. There is a no fly-zone for the flys, it is approximately 4 metres above the ground. Once they go above that they are zapped. Doesn&#096;t seem like a fair fight to me.
<br>
<br>
I wish something could zap the hobbits. May hire a hit man. An ex-Russian secret agent. I'm sure they
could deal with the hobbits quite efficiently.

The security guards have disappeared. I have no idea where they have gone. They were in their office last night, but this morning they are not.
<br>
<br>Strangely, there is a lingering odour in the garden. It is reminiscent of something which I can&#096;t put my finger on. 
<br>
<br>Oh well. I have a country to run. Off I trot.
<br>
<br>UPDATE 1 - 8:30am: apparently Armenia is on high alert. Unidentified beings have been spotted in the Norke Marash area. Coincidentally that is the district where I live. I wonder what creatures could be causing such mayhem?
<br>
<br>UPDATE 2 - 9:15am: The police called me at this morning, small smelly aliens have been spotted in my garden. I must leave my important duties here at HSBC to investigate with the KGB. They suspect me of colluding with the enemy.
<br>
<br>UPDATE 3 - 9:30am: AAAAAARGH!! The hobbits are here!!!
<br>
<br>UPDATE 4 - 11:00am: I have just woken up in a hospital bed. I fainted at the shock and could not be revived until now.

Here is a report from Kaelan and Adens minder from Wednesday.
<p />
<b>
Aden and Kaelan - 19th May 2010
</b>
<p />
Activities<br>
We popped into Waitrose Kaelan was very helpful with lifting the food from the basket. He looked on our bag for life and found some strawberry and some carrots which we were buying and a crab (which we weren't)
<p />
Kaelan did a lot of walking today between the schools and playgroup
<p />
Aden and Kaelan enjoyed seeing the Fire Engine, they were first shown the equipment including the hoses and ladders. Then they had the chance to sit in the back seat of the Fire Engine, Kaelan didn't want to but Aden did. They listened to the siren and then held on to the hose which squirted water (some of it went on our heads!) They came home and played with the wooden Fire station. Aden also played with the cars and the garage.
<p />
Kaelan pointed to an airplane in the sky, he said he came to England on a plane. At home on the blackboard he drew a plane. Kaelan told me that some other people are now living in his other house in England.
<p />
Kaelan played in the garden with Sophie, they played on the slide; in the house; on the trampoline; in the cars and bikes and played with some mud and water!
 <p />
Whilst Kaelan was having his nappy changed he counted really clearly to 34!! (Sophie can only count to 14!)
<p />
Nappy Change<br>
12.00pm - Aden and Kaelan (poo)<br>
5.00pm - Aden and Kaelan (K poo)

Aden 1.30 - 2.40pm - in cot

I am going to ban the admin assistant from having any involvement with my children. Here
are his versions of some childrens songs:
<p />
Baa baa blacksheep have you any wool?<br>
NO NO NO!
<p />
Bob the builder, can we break it?<br>
Bob the builder, yes we can.<br>
BANG BANG BANG!
<p />
abcdefg...<br>
THATS ENOUGH FOR ME!
<p />
He is such an idiot but the most worrying thing is that Kaelan and Aden find his
rhyming nonesense funny. He just has to invert everything!

Fair old England. Kaelan knows this is homeland. He promptly stopped speaking Armenian as soon he got off the plane and said "We don&#096;t need to speak Armenian any more. This is England." Here for one weeks hols.
<br>
<br>Aden has recently added "up there" to the roughly 10 words/phrases he knows. "No" is still is favourite, followed not far behind by "more". Soon he will be two years old and five words a year does not give one confidence that he will have a full vocabulary by the time he is 21.
<br>
<br>The timezone difference is causing havoc with everyones sleeping patterns. Aden is up a 4am every day.

Kaelan had his first sports day today. However, he didn&#096;t really participate in the sporting activities. Every time he was asked if he wanted to do something, he just said "no". However, I think he would make a good cheer leader. He was very excitable and danced quite a lot when the other competitors were doing their thing. Aden, was very keen but didn&#096;t quite understand the rules.
<br>
<br>Also Kaelan said today he wanted to wear pants and not nappies. That is good. Also, I am encouraging him not to wear a bib and suck his thumb. The bib will go quite easily, but I think the stopping of sucking of ones thumb could be a little bit more difficult.
<br>
<br>Did I tell you I passed an exam yesterday? Yes, I had to sit it to continue being CEO of HSBC Armenia. Of course, I passed. Infact I got 102%. The extra 2% was awarded for my intrinsic glamour.

Have I told you how much the boys love the ABC song? They do. They never stop singing it. Bathtime, Breakfast time, in the car, sitting on the potty, playing with the nanny,..."abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz...now I know my abc,...". Kaelan is very good at reciting it, he generally only makes a mistake at the "lmnop" bit. Aden, on the other hand, recites it with gusto but with only 1 in every 4 sounds produced correctly, but he isn&#096;t 2 yet, so that is ok. Confusingly, Kaelan wants to sing it the "American way". Who is he mixing with? Yankees? I hope not!

I miss Nero and Pasha you know. Nero is still my hero, and pasha was my second in command. Did I tell you Nero and Pasha came to stay with me while I was in San Francisco? Kaelan talks about Nero, though I am sure he can&#096;t remember him, Kaelan was only 1 when Nero died. Maybe there are deep rooted memories of Nero in Kaelan&#096;s head. Ruuskii is still in England, poor thing. He sends emails to me all the time. I don&#096;t think it makes sense to bring him over. He&#096;d have to spend too much time in quarantine. There are a lot of wild dogs over here as well. Not that I think that would bother Ruuskii. He&#096;s up for a fight, most of the time.

Witnessed a ritual sacrifice yesterday. A beheading at an ancient Christian church. They crowds were there taking photos, oh it was something the Brits do not do, thats for sure. The executioner sharpened his knife on a rock, then without a thought (and I am sure a smile on his face) off came the head. The body riggled and writhed for a few minutes, even though it was tied up. Shocking.
<br>
<br>Poor chicken. I suppose (and hope) it didn&#096;t know what was going on.
<br>
<br>The body was then hung upside down and taken through the crowds, luckily my boys didn&#096;t witness the murder or corpse being dragged away. Only minutes before they had been stroking the poor things feathers.

There has been a naughtiness shift away from Aden. I would say
Kaelan is the naugthiest now. I think it could be the teribble threes and not twos
for Kaelan.
<p />
Met some lovely cave dwellers in a village about 15km outside Goris.
You can see them in the photos. Quite sploshed they were. Drinking 80%
vodka. They saw through Kaelan and Aden though, Aden will play footbal and 
Kaelan will be a golfist. Raphael is the older gentleman who invited
us into his home, very charming. The kids almost ate him out of house and home.
No more fruit jam left in the cupboards after my boys wolfed it down.

Aden has a big scratch down his left cheek. Aparently a girl scratched him at the
Co-op school he attends. He must
have turned her down or something.

Unfortunately, Nana Nancy did eat too many root tubers on her birthday and blasted off into space in one almighty fart this morning at 8:50am. Goodbye NN, we will miss you!
<br>
<br>Only kidding, she is still rummaging around the woods of Thornwood like a proper little oik. Ah, April fools day, who would be without it.
<br>
<br>I now have a dinosaur boy. For over a week Kaelosaurus has been interested in dinosaurs. Everything is dinosaurs. T-rex, of course, Brachiosaurus, Pterodactyls and Tricerotops are his favourites. Aden is also progressing quickly. He can now say &#096;more&#096;. Infact that is almost all he says. &#096;More&#096; this &#096;more&#096; that. They both love lego, I must say.
<br>
<br>Interestingly, today Kaelan asked what comes from Africa? I said lions, giraffes, elephants. He, like a wise old man said, "they come from the zoo".

Beautiful, the opening of a new day. What a difference a month or so can make. Aden and Kaelan have been sleeping in the same room since we moved here and every morning Aden would wake up and start climbing into Kaelan&#096;s bed. But this was not what Kaelan wanted so the arguments would start and eventually end up with one or both of them crying. Sometimes they would patch things up quickly, sometimes not. Developing a good relationship in the morning has taken a while but they seem to be getting there.
<br>
<br>Suprisingly, to top it all off they are now telling the truth when I ask them if they have a poo in their nappies. Soon, I hope soon I will be free of nappies!
<br>
<br>Delight spreads across their faces when I say they have been good because they know they will get to see the Bees. Not CBeebies, but the Bees. It is a DVD.

The boys are going through a phase of licking things at the moment. First one starts, then the
other joins in. Trees, cars... you name it and they have all been "tasted". 
I obviously stop them as soon as I see them, as it can't be good for them, I'm sure.
However, this morning I came in for shock when they turned their attentions to the toilet.
Oh, dirty boys! Anyway, no harm seems to have come to them. The only thing that
I can think of that has influenced their behaviour are dogs or hobbits. I'm sure they must have seen 
Sidney or Ruuskii do their animalistic behaviour without restraint to all unsundry objects.
Oh, I've just had another thought, perhaps they have seen my sister snogging the toilet. She 
is so desperate at the moment it wouldn't surprise me if she resorted to such measures.

Went out into the Armenian lowland countryside today. Spring is definitely here! All the cherry blossom made Armenia quite beautiful and the mountains are still covered in snow.
<br>
<br>Since he has been three, Kaelan has learnt to get Aden to do his dirty work for him: "do you want to switch the light on?" he says to Aden in his most sweet voice, knowing full well the light is NOT to be switched on. Mostly Kaelan is an angel but he does have his moments. Aden on the other hand is a mischeavious tyke.
<br>
<br>Bought some paintings over the last few days, have found a couple of markets where artists congregate. Their work is of an exceptionally high technical level, where as their prices are not that demanding.
<br>
<br>May move to another house, one a bit further up the Norke hill. It has a pool, which I find is a necessity in these times.

I have found it! The perfect pickup joint for my sister. I chanced upon it at the weekend, 10,000 Armenian men, in all their black leather jacket splendour at a car auction on a 5 mile road of testostorone and Lada`s. She will have a field day when she comes over. Can you imagine it? They are not exactly Jesus types, but... I`m sure she will find at least one of these Hi hunks irresistable. In fact, she could have her squadron full if she wanted to!
<br>
<br>Talking about sausages, the dogs of Yerevan, poor things, had their bellys full of finest hot dog at the weekend. I went on a sausage drive in the suburbs, and made friends with at least 20 doggies.

Happy birthday to my Kaelan!! 
<br>
<br>I said "Happy Birthday Kaelan!" this morning when I first saw him and he said "Happy Birthday Mummy!". Aw isn`t that sweet. However he isn`t properly three until he gets cake, that`s what he said.
<br>
<br>That damn admin assistant knows how to spoil things though. He has to go to hospital to get his "bootmat" seen to today. Idiot.
<br>
<br>Saturday evening: Kaelan has had some cake now so he is now officially three. Well kind of. We went to a zoo today and if you were under three, you got in for free. So Kaelan became two again, even if it was only for a couple of hours.

Good to see you heeded my warning regarding Kaelans birthday presents. There has been a influx in the last couple of days.
<br>

As you ALL know, it is Kaelan`s 3rd birthday on Saturday. Cards and presents are a little bit down on last year and I know some of you are using the excuse that we have moved to make yourselves feel better for "forgetting", but be warned, that is no excuse!!
<br>
<br>Kaelan can count to 10 in Armenian. He also knows what an apple is, in fact he understands quite a bit. As does Aden, but he isn`t speaking English properly yet, so it isn`t quite as easy to tell.
<br>
<br>There is an uneasiness growing when I watch Aden eat or draw. With more regularity he is picking up felt-tip pens and knives and forks with his left hand. What can I do to stop him turning out left handed? Oh, they are so stupid, or should I say heemar!

<a href="../../imgs/2010/02/28/">photos</a>. The photo of the mountain is
mt Ararat. Apparently there is a boat at the top, I find that hard to believe somehow.
Also, we went to a mini indoor zoo yesterday. The animals were very friendly, they came out of their
cages to see us! Also, they are very friendly towards each other, a snake was sharing a cage 
with a small mouse, isn't that lovely!
<p />
Stopped by the side of the road today to see some sheep, they were lovely. Not sure what the hook
hanging by the side of the building and blood on the floor were from?

Went to Scottish country dancing yesterday. Not that hobbit kind of jiggy, which generally involves running around, showing your arse to all unsundry, no, my moves involved refined ballet-esque shapes and curves. I reminded everyone of Anna Pavlova. Light as a feather, and I swear the people watching thought I was a butterfly.

The Armenian language is not so easy to learn, but their word for sister is pronounced "queer". I think my sister is.
<br>
<br>Obviously it is healthy and acceptable to be homosexual and the Bible and Pope are misguided so why won`t she "come out"?

<br>I ask her now!

Now he is just plain lying. He said he went to Cape Canaveral. That is such a fib. I`ve heard it isn`t that good anyway. They`ve only got a couple of space helmets from the 60`s and a tiny bit of sand they claim is from the moon. No, I`m not jealous that Dog Fox Wolf claims he has been to Cape Canaveral one bit!
<br>
<br>I have made contact with the Yerevan mothers. I was happy to discover that one of them sends thier little boy to the same nursey as Aden. However, I was a little disconcerted to hear her description of a little boy who attends the same nursery and who growls if anyone approaches the toys he is playing with. Her description sounded remarkabley like Aden!

Back in Yerevan after moving out of the Epsom farm. Sad to leave. Both of my booboos first years were in that house and both of my first booboos died there. Kaelan has been asking when is he going back to his own house? Aden is fine about it all. Especially when he is eating, he doesn&#096;t have a care in the world. I think Aden would&#096;ve met his match if he&#096;d have met Mr Nero. Mr Nero and Aden have big appetites, thats for sure.
<br>
<br>Kaelan has chicken-pox. That`s not an official diagnosis, infact, its the total opposite. It stems from the admin assistant`s mouth. Therefore a hefty pinch of salt is required. However, Kaelan does have red spots and bites over his body, so perhaps the admin assistant is correct. Oh, and the bites don`t come from an exotic Armenian mosquito, they come from Aden. He is being supremely naughty at the moment. I do not want to bite him, but I may have to, to show him how it hurts to be bitten. At least my Mr Nero only took chunks out of those who deserved it.

After 2 days, Kaelan has noticed that all the child gates are no longer there. His observational skills need to be honed.
<br>
<br>Also, that smug admin assistant things he has got one over on me, he went for an eye test yesterday and came out of it with 20/20 vision. He will only have 20 vision once I poke one of his eyes out with a pen!

Busy, busy, busy. Packing up the Epsom farm is a big job. Just as well the packers are here for if it were left to the admin assistant the first box would still be empty. He is useless.
<br>
<br>Kaelan and Aden have been going to see their friends. They won&#096;t see them for a while after this weekend, poor things. Though already they are making waves in Armenian society.

<br>The hobbits witter on about a Bob for Aunt Kaza? She would never go for someone called Bob, ever. However, if they want to send a photo and a current CV to her, please send them via me. I would need to vet him first. Actually, if anyone knows a Jesus look-a-like, please let me know. Though, I must point out, Christianity has nothing to do with it. Aunt Kaza just likes the hippy, beardy types.

Parties, parties and more parties. I feel like I am on holiday. First the British Embassy, then Hotel Arma... then more tomorrow night. I am missing my booboos a little though, but socialising (and drinking!) has to be done of course. Though the line has to be drawn somewhere. A fan asked me to attend their Burns supper on Saturday night. I made some excuse about being vegetarian and sidled off. Yeuch, scottish hobbit gruel. No way!
<br>
<br>The admin assistant is complaining about changing nappies. Apparently by 11am today he had changed six shitty ones. 3 each!! Good going boys!

Kaelan is very, very good at sharing. He will share with Aden without any prompting
from me. Even when it comes to sharing a cup of orange juice (which is both of their favourite drink),
Kaelan will quite happily give to Aden. Aden on the other hand is a veritable
demon when it comes to trying to get him to give. His temper knows no bounds, and his face can
contort into the most frightening frown when asked to share.

Getting ready for my big day tomorrow as CEO HSBC Armenia. I have prepared my battle plan, I will fight on the beaches and in the trenches and I will take the due reward when it comes. I am expecting a knighthood from the King of Armenia after my time here. The Armenian nation will be better off, of that I have no doubt.
<br>
<br>I went to the Armenia history museum today, they have not had an easy time of it in recent centuries, though their earlier epochs have left a wealth of fascinating objects through out the last 100 millenia. A couple of nice 3000 year old chariots as well.
<br>
<br>Did I tell you about the plane flight over here? Oh, it wasn`t that bad, but we had a spate of shits for about 15 minutes that totally stunk out business class. Poor sods, they`d only paid 5k for the journey.
<br>
<br>More Armenian news tomorrow....

<br>Don`t worry Epsom mums, I will be back to Epsom in a week and a half! (I have had a few on the telephone already crying. They are missing me loads!)

<br>Aden will be going to the Old Barn nursery when we return to do the packing in two weeks time. 
<br>
<br>Ruuskii is at his temporary home in Orpy for a month, until all the Armenian paper work can be sorted out. He asked to go there, he likes old Orpy. He is missing us already, but we will be reunited soon.

<br>Where are Nero and Pasha? Oh, it makes me sad when I think of them. I have not moved to a new location without them, for 16 years!

At the breakfast table today, Kaelan quite unexpectedly splurted out that he was a spoon and Aden was a bowl. He then explained that the admin assistant was a dishwasher. Later on today, he further extrapolated that I am a fork, Ruuskii is a freezer and the car is a fridge.

Busy, busy and then very busy. So much to organise before moving to Armenia. I tell Kaelan about the impending move but I am unsure he understands the scale of the forth coming change. For Aden it is easier, he just wants more food, all the time. Chomping on food = happiness for Aden. He is much less discriminating than Kaelan when it comes to eating. However, I have no idea what will be served up in Armenia. What do they eat over there? I honestly do not know. I have heard they are not very keen on turkey.

<br>On the upside, my role is CEO. For those of you who don&#096;t know, CEO is the head honcho. I am preparing to excel, as always. Profits will go through the roof, of course.

Christmas has had quite an effect on Kaelan. Today, at Marwell zoo he picked up a little square chip from his plate and said "This is Jesus". He then picked up a more oblong chip and said "This is Mary" and placed it next to "Jesus" on his plate. He then pick up more chips, of varying sizes and described them as Joseph, the 3 three kings, a donkey etc... and placed them in a semi-circle around "Jesus". Now, what do you make of that? Christianity has had a profound effect on the West and is now having a effect on Kaelans eating habits! For he would not eat the chips of the Nativity even when the slobbering admin assistant threatened to eat them himself.
