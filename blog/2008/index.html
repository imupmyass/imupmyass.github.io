2008! And the miracle of Aden. My miracle, no-one else was involved.

<strong>31st Dec 2008</strong>
<p>
On this last day of 2008 I'd just like to say why hell do I feel ill at this time
of year again? It really isn't on. However, I shall be a hero and look
after my children while the admin assistant fumbles around. Incapable of
even looking after himself.
</p>
<p>
So, please have a good time without me tonight. Have a drink and toast my
good name, as usual. I shall think of you when you the time comes and
you can praise me in glorious celebration once again. I
will lead you, my precious fans through these times of financial woe.
My tip for 2009 is this: remember to keep some money for my birthday and Christmas presents.
</p>
<p>
Happy New Year when the time comes!!
</p>

<strong>30th Dec 2008</strong>
<p>
It was beautiful and clear this evening so I thought I'd show Kaelan the stars.
You know, stars like in the poem "Twinkle Twinkle", not stars of the human kind. He
sees one of them everyday. We were looking up in  awe, and I asked him (rhetorically)
did he know where the stars came from? His speach is developing quickly, but I am unsure 
of how to interpret his
answer: "howdivakenthatamnoeventwaeeerthieejitroondhere"
</p>
<p>
?? It sounded suspiciously hobbit like.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>29th Dec 2008</strong>
<p>
Still returns to the Epsom farm. The hobbits have vacated. 
Nancy was upset to leave me, as can be expected. Sidney looked a bit fatter, thats all.
</p>
<p>
Kaelan has done some developing lately. He can now say "please" instead of "plea" (The "s" sound
was a big obstacle for him).
He can accurately describe objects as little or big. He can eat his breakfast independantly and
without making (much) mess.
He also needs a haircut. I haven't taken him for one yet. Luckily Aden's hair is a bit
thicker, though it is a bit patchy. Kaelan can also say "one, two, three"!
Does he know what numbers are? I think he does, since if you 
ask him if he would he like one grape or three, he always holds up five fingers!!
</p>
<hr>
<strong>27th Dec 2008</strong>
<p>
Chilly day here in 
<a href="../../imgs/2008/12/27frost/">Epsom</a>. 
I have tried to explain the technical difference between
frost and snow to Kaelan but I am unsure he understands.
Snow is what he knows and snow is what it is!
</p>
<p>
Went to see SOF today. The journey there went swimmingly, under 1 hour from door to door.
Here are some 
<a href="../../imgs/2008/12/27sof/">photos</a>.
Coming back took two and half hours. Oh what an ordeal! Though Nancy did well. 
Having two hungry booboos in the back of a car is not pleasant.
However, like a real life action hero, 
she jumped into and out of the car (while it was moving!),
running between shops, trying to buy baby food. 
She was on a mission. She was like a member of the SAS darting between doors
on a suicide operation.
Then, once she had accomplished her task she
lept back into the car through the window. I was quite astonished.
Meanwhile, Sid and the admin assistant were following in the 
admin assistant's rust bucket a few cars behind, completely 
oblivious to Nancy's heroics.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>26th Dec 2008</strong>
<p>
The admin assistant involved himself with my family and constructed a
toy which Aunt Polly had shipped from Hobawick. The kids really love it:
<a href="../../imgs/2008/12/26/">photos</a>.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>25th Dec 2008</strong>
<p>
Not even 12 o'clock and I am exhausted: 
<a href="../../imgs/2008/12/25/">photos</a>.
Santa left so many presents it has taken all morning to open them. Phew.
Aden seems to have a technique to opening presents. First he dribbles on the paper
to soften it up then tears it. Kaelan has been running from one side of the room to the
other very excitedly. It is all go in Epsom today!
</p>
<p>
And of course, thank you for all your pressies and warm wishes. I will respond
to you all, once I have time. Realistically I am too busy to reply, but I will
think a kind thought for you... Merry Christmas!
</p>
<p>
Now, I will oversee the maid, while she is making Christmas dinner.
</p>
<p>
Christmas dinner:

</p>
<p>
After we had luncheoned, I did the traditional thing and tuned into the Queens speach. I listened to her
wisdom with an unquestioning mind. She is the Queen after all. However, due to her
 refined accent, I am unsure the hobbits followed what She said. "whaedizshethinksheez" and "sheezfuloersellsosheez"
 were all the hobbits could murmer.
<a href="../../imgs/2008/12/25queen/">photos</a>.
</p>
<p>
Today has been a good day, but I have missed my boys. My darling Nero and Pasha. 
I find it very hard when they are not here at times like this. They were always here.
My original booboos.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>23rd Dec 2008</strong>
<p>
Two days to go!!
</p>
<p>
Went shopping today. Shopping makes me happy. I think sleeping makes the 
hobbits happy. Especially Sidney. It almost feels like I have 3 children in the house at them moment.
In fact, I think Kaelan and Aden sleep less than Sid.
Though the senior hobbit has been pulling his weight a bit more this visit. I think I have counted three sh*tty
nappies he has helped with during this stay. However, changing channels on the TV
can be a challenge for Nancy: "howdivaturnthitellee". She whines, waving the remote control in front
of my face until I randomly chose another channel. This appeases her for while, then she is back.
Perhaps I should revise the number of children to 4. 
</p>
<p>
Then they
start fighting: "dinnidaethateernoinchaergeothezappirgeeithere". I assume the argument is something
to do with which channel they are watching, since they are trying to tug the remote control out
of each others paws.
</p>
<p>
The translation team have almost given up. They have no idea where to start when it comes to 
deciphering these creatures verbal habits.
Some of the most talented of the team are desperately trying to find their Rosetta Stone.
However, what are these idiotic creatures liable to be saying? Is it
really worth us knowing? "eevyasedthilastothibogroll", "eelhetibrikitsbacktigetitdoonwithootfluddinthihoos".
Do we really want to know what could be pushing these animalistic minds into the act of speach?
</p>
<p>
However, perhaps it would be useful to know what the hobbits are saying. Perhaps they could provide an insight into
the formulation of belief systems and abstract notions of the world that could explain how 
our primitive cousins developed language and culture. 
</p>
<p>
So what does "amganfuracrap" really mean? Come on translation team, keep your peckers up!
</p>

<strong>22nd Dec 2008</strong>
<p>
Aden's first Christmas is going to be very special. He will have me and Kaelan
to show him the ropes. We will help him open his presents and play with his toys.
Then we will play charades and have a merry time before retiring to bed on the 25th.
One thing concerns me though, how do I hide the hobbit drool and debauchery of
their eating antics at the Christmas dinner table? I fear my children will be scared witless by the 
elbows and feet flying during the meal. The hobbits are so rough when they
have a turkey sitting in front of them, and are filled with alcohol. 
I remember last year 
in Hobawick, they were bearing their teeth at each other before the meal started! 
Luckily Nero was sitting next to me. When he growled, the hobbits made whimpering noises
and scuttled off into the corners of the room. I felt quite safe.
This year, there is no Nero. I have Ruuskii of course but I am unsure
if he can contend with the animal fervour that comes over these little hairy oiks.
</p>
<p>
Poor Nero, poor Pasha. Little did I know that one year ago would be their last Christmas here on Earth.
How I miss them. I feel they are with me though. Perhaps not physically but definitely in
their caring presence. Nero would defend me against a hundred 100 tigers and Pasha would 
box a fox for me.
</p>
<p>
But you know, realistically, the hobbits are so debauched they are more like
jellied farts than a threat. They lollip from one reclining position to another. Moaning and groaning
like expectant hippos. After a meal, vague sentence like noises squeeze from their mouths: "ohamritexausteedmie",
"eerpuggledsoeeer", "thisbaitsworkin" are just a few of their semantic burps that no one listens to
or acknowledges. Ah, the life of a hobbit is an easy one.
</p>
<p>
As for me, I have things to do. To prepare! To make a great day!!
</p>
<p>
I will update you on my progress, while the hobbits snooze.
</p>

Sidney has been making an effort, though I would not like to say it is a 
satisfactory effort. At the moment, though, he is on the right side of the law.
Lets hope it stays that way. Here are his utterings on his conduct so far:
</p>
<p>
"amjisootohospitalamnomasell"
</p>
<p>
I have the translation team working on this witter as we speak.
Anyway, here are some

Also, what chance would Alexandra have had if we had been been in the X-Factor?
Here is evidence that she would have had none: <a href="../../vids/canthaveyou.wmv">The Clifford Sisters</a>.

<strong>20th Dec 2008</strong>
<p>
A rushed charter has been draughted and 
<a href="../../imgs/charter2.png">signed</a>. 
</p>
<p>
They arrived today. Without warning.
Even though I was on high alert due to the time of year, they sneaked over the fence and started climbing
up the drain pipes. Then Ruuskii warned me. Oh dear, oh dear. Lawyers are so expensive at short notice.
But so worth it. Sidney signed, as witnessed by us all. 
</p>
<p>

I warn thee now, oh Sidney Hobbit. Cross 
me and ye shall feel my festive wrath.

Aunt Kaza has spoken:
</p>
<p>
<font color="blue">
I think one word best describes my stay in Epsom for all those 
who had the pleasure of coming in contact with me: INSPIRATIONAL!!!!!
</p>
<p>
I totally "wowed" everyone at the mother and baby groups and I'm pleased 
to announce that the fabulous Clifford Sisters were 
reunited for an amazing rendition of "Valerie". 
In fact, the camera crew said that only difference between us 
and the X factor winner was that we had talent! 
</p>
<p>
The babies are totally gorgeous - such a big love story between 
me and Kalean. It's all sorted. He's coming to Malta next 
year, I just have to master how to manouvre that damn pushchair.
</p>
<p>
Poor admin assistant still being worked to death. 
He's up at the crack of dawn, bathing, feeding and dressing the babies. 
In fact, Aden bears an uncanny resemblance to him when he was a baby!
Astrid occasionally swanned in and out usually to turn up the volume on the TV or give orders.
All in all, everyone had a wonderful time.and I enjoyed myself too!
</p>
<p>
Will be back again very soon so start practising your chicken surprise Cock! 
And recharge the batteries on the vidcam. Next time..., a Wham medley!

Still haven't received the description of her stay in Epsom from my sister. 
</p>
<p>
Also, I am sure the hobbits said something about coming down
for Christmas, but no sign of them yet. 
</p>

<strong>17th Dec 2008</strong>
<p>
One day, a crazy English womain who lives in Malta had a problem with her PC. She was sitting at her computer
trying to get onto the internet but unable to. She was contemplating calling the company that provided her
internet connection to complain but she dreaded calling them. She felt the customer
support engineers always laughed at her and her lack of knowledge.
However, after about an hour of clicking "Send/Receive" in Outlook, she bit the bullet and phone them:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
      dring dring...dring dring...
      
[phone picked up]	
      Hello, XXXX here, your friendly Maltese customer support engineer. 
      How can I help you?
      
[rant]
      Your service isn't working again!! I have a problem with the service 
      you provide...
      
[calm]
      OK, could explain the problem pls?
      
[rant continues...]
      ...IT NEVER WORKS AND YOU JUST LAUGH AT ME... [sob]
      
[calm]
      OK, could you close all your Windows pls?
      
[bemused delay]
      All my windows are closed. The back door is open for my cats though.
      
[calm - with smile on face] 
      OK, can you see your Desktop?
      
[bemused irritaion]
      I don't have a desktop. My PC is on my coffee table!
      
[calm - but starting to laugh and unable to hide it]
      What error are you receiving?

[still bemused but with purpose now]
      Outlook won't connect.

[..sigh..]
      Untick "Work Offline".
      
[happy surprise]
	  Thats it!! ITS WORKING NOW. YOU ARE A GENIUS!!
	  
[sound of chair falling to its side and the snap of a taught rope. 
A gurgle or two, then silence] 

[still happy]
      Hello, hello? Oh I think he's hung up.
</pre>
</p>
<p>
That is a true story. Word for word. My sister is amazing.
My sympathies to the family of the customer engineer. He was a good man but 
just wasn't prepared for the level of idiocy that some people can stoop to.
</p>
<p>
Also, I am expecting her to write a few lines about her stay at the Epsom
farm and seeing my wonderful children. 
</p>

I spoke too soon. Aunt Kaza arrives today. I am going to give my Stilton and biscuits to

<strong>7th Dec 2008</strong>
<p>
I decided to humour the admin assistant (and his geeky friends). The admin assistant
 was very pleased with himself after
passing an exam on Friday so I thought I would show him who has the real talent round here.
See the 
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaUq0Xp8k8g">
vid</a>! I expect it will get international acclaim.
(here is a less compressed 
<a href="../../vids/ccna-song.wmv">version</a>, approx 3.4MB)
</p>
<p>
For those of you who are sad enough and want to know, CCNA stands for Certified Cisco Network 
Associate. There are other acronyms in my "techy" version of the Village People classic 
but they are really not very interesting.
However, I know you will ask, so here they are: 
LAN = Local Area Network, 
WAN = Wide Area Network, 
MAN = Metropolitan Area Network. 
Enjoy!!!

Importantly, here is a

Goodbye Pashee, I will never stop loving you. Now you can be with 
your brother Mr Nero. Now he can look after you, like he did down here...

Obviously some photos are more important than others. This 
<a href="../../imgs/2008/10/25/">photo</a>
is immeasurably more important than any containing the admin assistant.
I purchased a buggy board for Kaelan. He took to it like a duck to water.

Naturally, Nancy had aspirations for her offspring. So much so she even organised a
photo 
<a href="../../imgs/scanned/adminpollyshoot/">shoot</a>
 for them. Unfortunately hobbits don't very often make it into modelling.
In fact I have never seen one scuttling along a catwalk. Legs too short you see.

I don't think a set of photos that have appeared on IMUPMYASS.COM

Think I can feel a poem coming on:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
	Looking upwards, I can see the sky.
	But things are in the way.
	They are the branches of my life.
	Spiralling up-away.
	
	The blueist hue is peeking through.
	Leaves and wood are in between.
	Alive and dead, not fallen yet.
	Down to where I lean.
	
	Surrounded by the growing grasses,
	That feel the summer sun.
	How lucky I am,
	To still have a gorgeous bum.

Pasha is not well. The poor thing is struggling a bit.

Oh so busy. However I always make time for some holidays.
Had a call from an old friend saying she was going up to the Lakes for a week.
Thought I'd take the kids along for the ride just to show them that England is
more beautiful than anywhere else on the planet (esp Scotland).
Here are the <a href="../../imgs/2008/10/keswick/">photos</a>.
</p>
<p>
I was just getting to like the Lakes when the admin assistant drugged me and drove me
up to Scotland and to Hobawick. I was furious when I awoke but the happy Hobbits persuaded
me to stay. <a href="../../imgs/2008/10/hawick/">Photos</a>.

Kaelan has a fascination with tractors at the moment. Luckily for the admin assistant
he knew a family member who has a collection.

My, how I feel sorry for the elderly. Went to Div's 50th birthday party yesterday.
How he wobbled round the dance floor. Lucky me, I have another 20 years before I 
get that ancient!
<a href="../../imgs/2008/09/20b/">Photos</a>.
Me and some Orpers danced the night away, exhibiting our youthful flowing prowess.
We gave quite a show! 
</p>
<p>
Drove to Hampshire today, to Marwell Zoo. You know I could drive and drive. I love driving.
Though the kids do start to moan, as does that admin assistant. 2 hours, 4, 6, infact I wish there
were more hours in the day so I could just keep on driving!!

Will Aden and Kaelan remember going for walks on 
<a href="../../imgs/2008/09/12/">Epsom Downs</a>?
I am unsure, they are both very young and at this stage and I think they will only remember me.
</p>
<p>
...and Ruuskii perhaps. I hope they remember Ruuskii running around and being happy. 
Chasing unsuspecting dogs and sitting where he feels appropriate.
<p>
My only regret is I don't think either of them will remember Nero.
I wish they could, but apparently that is unlikely for Aden,
since he wasn't born when Nero was around.
But Kaelan speaks as though Nero was here only yesterday! Nero this, and Nero that!
Every thing is "Nero", or is it "gero" or "dido" or "deedo"?  Oh I do not know.
Kaelan is speaking in a more and more complex code that I think only he and the wallpaper understand.

Aden only has eyes for me.

Sidney Hobbit wrang today, asking about Aden. I do hope Sidney and Nancy don't think the admin assistant

Ruuskii was jumping up, almost standing on his hind legs, gently trying to see and smell Aden.
Of course, Kaelan will have to tell Aden about Nero when they are both a bit older
but Nero will still be Aden's guardian angel until then.

My! How the roulette wheel of fate spins! Sid has been in hospital for a couple 
of days with an infection not too disimilar to Kaelan's. He has been on oxygen and
an antibiotic intravenous  drip. Nana Nancy called up last night to let us know.
Fortunately, she wasn't that bothered and seemed to be enjoying the break.
Anyway, he seems to be making progress...
</p>
<p>
On to more important matters! The puppy is arriving today! Yipee. 
It is getting dropped off at 3pm. Can't wait. I have been waiting 
a week for it already. The breeders have been fobbing me of with excuses about 
it not wanting to leave its mummy! Selfish things, they just want
to keep him for themselves!
</p>
<font color="darkblue">
<p>
<big><marquee width="200px"><blink>CHANGE OF PLAN!!</blink></marquee></big>
</p>
<p>
At 8am this morning (just after previous post) I decided to not get the puppy but have a baby instead.
I felt that it was unfair to take the puppy away from its mummy and
owners since they seemed so happy with it. Once I had made my mind up 
it was a simple process of deciding what kind of baby I wanted; dark hair, gender (male of course!), cute (like Kaelan),
between 8-9lbs, etc. When I had finished deciding I just went to the hospital and out it popped.
So baby Aden was born at 9:40am in the Kingston Hospital. A true miracle of me. He weighs in at
8lbs 10oz and amazingly looks like Kaelan when he was born. He has supped his first milk, had a little snooze
and deposited his first tar.
</p>
<p>
Kaelan has not met Aden yet. I put him in the care of the child minder since he is not 
too keen on hospitals. Kaelan will meet Aden today, I do hope they get on.
</p>
</font>
<p>
<big>UPDATE:</big>
</p>
<p>
Kaelan was slighly bemused by Aden at first but after a while he was stroking his head and prodding his
eyes like he does to Ruuskii. So everything is fine (I hope).
</p>

Kaelan's language development has faltered, I feel. Everything is a "gock". 
Everything that isn't a word he knows, that is.
</p>
<p>
The admin assistant has failed. He is trying to come up with ideas
with what to do with dirty nappies.
</p>
<p>
I am glorious and a perfect mother. Patient to the last!!

The 6th day of the 7th month of the 8th year. Today has a bit of 
ring to it, don't you think? 
</p>
<p>
The rules of tennis are complicated, don't you find?
These people playing tennis are doing things with numbers that I've never
seen anyone attempt in the bank. Also, what's all this juice about?
</p>
<p>
Anyway, to more important matters. That tadpole I was telling you about
is still in the pond! I am getting slightly anxious about it. Perhaps I
should try and assist it. I mean, how long can it stay a tadpole?
</p>
<p>
Also, Ruuskii nearly got nipped today. By a big Alsation. It would have served 
him right to be honest. Nero wouldn't stand for any nonsense from Ruuskii,
so why should anyone else?
</p>

The Tits have also flown the nest. Aah, it reminds so much of Kaelan.
All the Spring babies making their new way in the world.

I can feel a poem coming on.

Till next spring, and to all the new life it will bring...<br>
You can you hear them all sing... The creative juices flow in me you know. It's obvious.

<p>
When I went to pond today, there was only one tadpole swimming around.
All the others had scarpered. But I suppose they had to leave their pond 
at some point! We all do.
</p>
<p>
The little puppy will be getting weened from its mummy now. When
it arrives I am sure I will see Nero's eyes and start crying...
But then I will be happy for it, because I will be its new mummy.
And it will be happy to meet me, like every one else is.
</p>
<p>
Kaelans latest word is "keys". Though to the unitiated it might seem
as though he is trying to spit, it is in fact his attempt a
the english language. I am so proud of him.

My stomach has expanded so much my belly button has

It is so big it is causing me to be lop-sided. I wobble now and again.
To the point where I almost fall over. I may need some balast at the rear, but
in saying that I've got my ass! Though it is not expanding 
at the same rate as my belly. Oh what is going on with my body?

Thankyou, thankyou, thankyou all for the wonderful cards and lovely messages
you have sent me.
It makes me so happy to know that my birthday brings so much joy to every corner of the world.
However, this year is the first year without Nero, so my heart is tinged with sadness. 
But I will still save him some cake!
In fact he can have the one the hobbits sent, it looks as though it was made out of dog food
(or is it mud?).
</p>
<p>
Also, on this special day I'd like to give thanks to all the doctors 
and nurses who looked after Kaelan when he wasn't well.
He seems 
to be doing fine. His cheekiness levels are rising every day.
</p>
<p>
And another good thing to look forward to..... the new puppy!!! It will soon be six weeks old
and will be able to leave its mummy. Yipee!!

It is not good when you are on firstname terms with the receptionists at AnE.
I had to go today, I had a tremendous pain in my left shoulder this morning and thought I was going to pass out.
Even after a couple of stiff whiskys, the pain wouldn't abate so
in the end I thought it best the driver take me to Epsom Hospital. I was checked over by an army of
doctors and nurses and they wanted 
to keep me in overnight but 
the room I was in wasn't up to scratch so I signed myself out.
</p>
<p>
Bombastic me? Just don't forget my pressies.

Oh, I think all the commotion of the last few days has been too much.
Hobbits have gone.
Kaelan has slept all day, as have I. I'm sure I am more exhausted than I should be.
I can't be getting old, after all I'm only 32!
Puppy arrives soon, I'm sure that will perk me up.

Oh what a fantastic day! The Derby was venjoyable even though
I didn't have a winner. The Downs were buzzing with helicopters,
stars (me included), royalty (me included) and some vbeautiful horses.
As can be expected I had a prime spot for viewing the days events, right
next to the finishing post, it had 
a marvelous view of the home stretch. 
Lydia had a good run with the book makers which made her very happy, as can
be expected. The squeals of delight could be 
heard all over the Downs. Jiminy got into trouble for betting with money that wasn't his own!
Tut tut. Nancy got drunk, to the point where she couldn't stand up. Sid
lost all his money. Aparently this is his normal when it comes to Sid and horse racing.
Kaelan slept through the big event. I think he is exhausted after having the hobbits
here for a few days. I was graceful and signed autographs with dignity and regality.
The admin assistant wittered.
</p>
<p>
<a href="../../imgs/2008/06/thederby/">Photos</a>.

Also, can anyone translate: "ITWUZBAITBEEASSNOTTUR"? Jiminy roared this at the end of 
races quite often, however it has my transaltion team baffled.

<p>
Oh. I have a sore head.
</p>
<p>
The hobbits arrived 2 days ago. I knew they were going to cause mayhem
when they arrived. 
</p>
<p>
Let me explain, in general I do not drink very much alcohol but these creatures
have obviously been practicing for a long time. They have been quite forcefully plying me with drink.
They are animals once they get going.
Often it can get to the stage where their antics are quite obscene.
Lydia is a heller. Jiminy is a perpetrator of wickedness. And as for Sid and Nancy
they are going their ends.
</p>
<p>
The whailing, howling and screeching didn't stop last night. I was unsure what to 
make of it at first but I think in their strange way they were having fun. 
At least I think they were tears of laughter I saw but I almost called the police due the levels of debauchery.
Where are you Nero? My protector.
</p>
<p>
At some points they were lashing the liquid down their
gullets so fast, it was like they had just been rescued after being at sea for six weeks.
</p>
<p>
Today is annual running of the Derby Stakes. I am quite worried how it will all finish.
I expect to be found in a ditch on the Downs tomorrow morning. Oh dear.
</p>

<p>
I spoke too soon. A letter from Nancy Hobbit arrived this morning 
(they don't have telephones or email so far up north).
She is coming down for the Derby, Sid is in tow, as is one of 
her friends. I can't make out from her handwriting what her friend is called, perhaps
Lydia or Cindy, with a surname of Broom or Brew is it? 
They left their burrows one month ago and hope to be here tomorrow. Oh dear.
</p>
<p>
A burrow for three, I'll instruct the gardener to get cracking.

<p>
Its the Derby this weeked. I expect the usual riff-raff will appear on
the door step. Drunks, layabouts and general good-for-nothingers
accumulate on or around the Downs at this time of year.
As usual I will put up the barricades.
</p>
<p>
Stay away! You mischief makers!
</p>
<p>
I only have Ruuskii to protect me this year. He may be a lovely dog but I'm not 
sure where his back bone is. Nero's was made of finest steel.
</p>
<p>
You know, it wouldn't surprise me if a bus load of hobbits appeared this weekend.
Looking for a bed. I may get the gardener to make a little burrow 
for them all. At the far side of the farm.

Kaelan was taken to AnE yesterday evening. I noticed a strange skin condition on his 
right thigh/buttock and took him to the doctors immediately. The doctor
was unsure what this lumpy like condition was and advised I take him to hospital 
straight away. The doctors at the hospital 
thought it was a side effect of the antibiotic injections he had
recieved when he had septic arthritis. Anyway they thought it was
harmless and advised I keep an eye on it. Oh, this is not easy you know. My little booboo.
</p>
<p>
Hopefully when the new puppy arrives things will get back to normal.
Not having Nero around is still very upsetting. Poor noonoo.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>26th May 2008</strong>
<p>
Kaelan makes quite a few different noises and definitely believes he
is speaking sense (much like the admin assistant!) however,
I can only make out what these three words mean:
</p>
<p>
Mama = I want
</p>
<p>
Duckduck = Duck
</p>
<p>
Go = Ball
</p>
<p>
Mama may mean mummy as well, but I am unsure.

The tadpoles are gaining legs. The newt tadpoles that is. We have different kinds of tadpoles.
 Newt ones and frog ones. The frog ones are a bit behind. They are smaller and invisibly dark.
 The heron used to enjoy them, until he ate them. The frog ones that is.
Until things became 50/50. Now he has stopped. Initially they were 90/10. If not less!
</p>
<p>
Now I would say things are 50/50, definitely. You see, nature has different ways 
of doing things. Mass and select. I am select of course. As is Kaelan.
</p>
<p>
Things mass should not have been born. Or at least less frequently, I'd suggest.
</p>
<p>
Then, to finish, of course, Nero was select. The MOST select. I hope he is ok.

Kaelan is almost back to where he was just over 3 weeks ago in terms of walking.
Not quite as proficient but I am hoping in one week he will be back to the same point. I 
will be very grateful if he is. At the bleakest moments I was unsure of anything.
</p>
<p>
One of the Epsom mother's children has tonsilitis. I thought "...how quaint" when I heard.
If only she knew what a proper illness was about! However, I hope they never
have to go through the same ordeal that me and booboo went through. It was really quite dreadful.
</p>
<p>
Oh, did you read the headlines today? "Men are not required". Too true.
It is now official, legal and signed off. We don't need'em to have babies! Yipee!! If 
I were ever to consider having a second I would be quite happy doing it on my own.
You know the headline should really have been: "We don't need'em, FULL STOP!!"

<strong>17th May 2008</strong>
<p>
It was very nice to see Astrid, Kaelan and the admin assistant in Malta,
but they did harp on and on about me changing a nappy.
</p>
<p>
So, I thought I would write a little something about Astrid's early
years, just to set the record straight.
</p>
<p>
I was 3 years old and fast asleep. Suddenly, I was awakened by an
ear-shattering "neighhhhhhhh" from the next room. Astrid was born at
home and entered the world thinking she was a horse. She remained under
that delusion until she was 18.
</p>
<p>
Mummy had to be taken to hospital and Astrid was left under the care of
my father who was instructed to give her sugar water every 3 hours. I
remember sitting on the stairs, peaking through the banisters, terrified
of this tiny thing with masses of black hair lying in her cot. My father
tried to entice me to enter the room but every time I tip-toed closer,
she'd let out an ear-splitting neighhhhhhh and I'd run for cover.
</p>
<p>
By the age of about 5, her horse persona had split and sometimes she
thought she was a dog. She alternated between 'horse days' and 'dog
days'. On 'dog days' she would scamper up and down the stairs on all
fours - barking and cocking her leg against the chair legs. Her food had
to be minced and she'd lap it up like a dog from a bowl on the hall
floor. On 'horse days' she'd gallop around the hours, neighing and
baying and stomping her hooves. On 'horse days' she would eat he food
form a nose bag (made by myself from a black bin liner) which she hung
round her neck. Whether having a 'horse day' or a 'dog day', she was
extremely annoying. She refused to play like other children. My
Shakespearean talent as a writer was evident from an early age and
whenever I wrote and staged one of my wonderful plays, I would always
have to re-write the whole thing to incorporate a horse!! Or, when I
organized fete in the back garden, all the other children would sell
perfume that we'd made from rose petals or baked cakes or
something....normal! But Astrid would sell sugar lumps which the
visitors then had to feed her - if they didn't she'd bite and kick them!
</p>
<p>
Her equestrian identification may explain her bowl problems. As I've
already described in all too vivid detail, Astrid used to poo in the
bath with terrifying regularity. She was also unable to wipe her own
bottom until the age of 16. This unenviable task used to fall to my
mother, but on those dreadful, dreadful days when mummy was busy, this
terrible duty was passed on to me. This has, of course, left
irreversible psychological scars, which is why, unfortunately, until
this day I am unable to change a nappy.

I am unsure where I get my dancing and music talent from but I think Kaelan has 
inherited it. Kaelan has started enjoying music again.
</p>
<p>
Come to think of it Nero could dance. And he could howl if the situation required it,
or if he wanted to. As Kaelan gets older, I am sure Nero is Kaelan's real daddy.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I can see the photos of Kaelan in the womb and he does look like a puppy.

Poor Nero. He will never meet Kaelan's puppy.

<p>
Kaelan's mobility is improving.
He is starting to stand more, and even take a few small steps whilst holding onto furniture.
All good news...
</p>
<p>
Here are some 
<a href="../../imgs/2008/05/thomas/">photos</a>
of a small present Kaelan received to help him get better.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>10th May 2008</strong>
<p>
Today has been a splendid day. Lovely weather and a walk in the Nonsuch park. Venjoyable.
</p>
<p>
Kaelan had a runny nose so I almost took him to hospital to get it checked out but 
I was talked out of it at the last minute. I am a little on edge you know, but I think the 
dark days are over. Phew! 
</p>
<p>
To celebrate I think I should get a puppy for Kaelan. Not yet, 
it is a bit too soon. But perhaps in a month or two. I think the start of July is a good time...
</p>
<hr>
<strong>9th May 2008</strong>
<p>
He's back. Booboo is back! He's sleeping upstairs!!! Yipee!! 
</p>
<p>
The hospital staff did a great job and I hope they understand, but he belongs here, in our house. 
</p>
<p>
THANKYOU to everyone that took part in Kaelans revival. He will know what you've done
later. Just now, he is too interested in squinting his eyes and shouting at the plastic duck
in the pond.
</p>
<p>
He came home last night. He has been a bit naughty today, but I suspect that is because he
has been thoroughly spoiled. Everyone has been very worried about him,
and he knows it. Though he can do no wrong in my eyes.
</p>
<p>
However, If he dares cough of splutter in the next 48 hours he is going back to hospital.
Infact if he coughs of splutters in the next 48 days he is going back to hospital.
</p>
<p>
My booboo is back! Yipee.....!!

<p>
Poor thing.
</p>
<p>
The swelling on Kaelan's left leg has almost gone. The infectection indicators in
his blood have come down from 250 to 37. He is getting better. However
the worry is that he has long term damage. The doctors are hopeful that he will
be ok but as a convicted parent I still worry. 
</p>
<p>
The second operation I mentioned a few days ago was to insert 2 IV drips for 
the nurses to administer antibiotics. They couldn't find any more veins on my little 
booboo because he is too chubby. These two have stopped working now so they may
have to put Kaelan in theatre again, to try and find new viens. This 
is all very stressfull, for both of us.
</p>
<p>
Nana Nancy has been making a contribution though. She
has stayed in the hospital and looked after Kaelan while I have been having a rest.
She is doing a good job though the hospital staff initally thought she was
here to have some speech therapy lessons. They do struggle to understand her; 
"eissarethairdedaethatdaeitlikethisletmeidaeitakenwhatamdain!",
I'm not sure her input is truly valued.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes I forget the plight of others. There are some children in Kaelans
ward that are much worse off than him. Even if he doesn't fully recover (please let him recover)
he will be better off than some. 
On the other hand some kids don't have a scratch on them. Seriously,
they come in to the ward in the morning and are out by the evening. 
Generally they are snivelling but not much else!
</p>
<p>
Nero never gave me this trouble when he was small.
</p>
<p>
It has been lovely weather the last few days. The tadpoles are growing.
Nero, Kaelan and Ruuskii should have been playing in the garden....
</p>
<hr>
<strong>6th May 2008</strong>
<p>
Tonight will be the fifth night for Kaelan in hospital. 
He has been very brave. He has been jabbed and prodded more times than he
would like and unfortunately he doesn't know it is for the good of him.
Hopefully one day he will understand what and why the doctors and nurses have done. 
</p>
<p>
I hope all this has no long lasting effects. 
Physically and mentally. He seems to be able to sit on a chair 
with out feeling pain. You can see he doesn't feel 100% when his is on all
fours though. But at least he is trying to move on all fours!
</p>
<p>
The emergency hobbit has been called. She arrives this evening.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>4th May 2008</strong>
<p>
I am exhausted. The last 5 days have been a roller coaster ride that I would rather
not have got on. Really, I do not know where to start, but more than anything, at least Kaelan is still 
alive. The poor little thing has been very ill, and very strong.
</p>
<p>
Let me explain: Kaelan is in hospital and may be having his second operation tomorrow, 
the second in just a couple of days.
The scarlet fever I told you about in the
last blog was not contained by the penicillin. In fact, the infection had most probably
progressed past the stage of where penicillin could have helped Kaelan. 
He has (or hopefully had) septic Arthritis. Specifically a
bacterial infection of his left hip joint. Which, if left untreated, could have proven fatal.
</p>
<p>
"Fatal" means dead btw. Here is a definition of septic arthritis from the 
ever accurate internet:
</p>
<p>
<code>
Septic arthritis is an infection in a joint. 
Symptoms include pain and tenderness over a joint, pain on moving the joint, and feeling unwell. 
It is an uncommon infection, but serious. 
Urgent treatment is needed. 
This includes antibiotics, and drainage of infected fluid from the 
joint to prevent permanent joint damage.
</code>
</p>
<p>
Kaelan seems to be responding to the treatment and care he has been recieving
at the Queen Mary's Childrens Hospital in Carshalton (part of St Helier's Hospital in Surrey).
We have found the experience difficult and at times traumatic but we have 
maintained extreme regality throughout (though that blubbering idiot the admin
assistant has let the side down at times). 
I do not know who to thank more for Kaelans survival, the staff or 
the scientists? The staff have been exemplary, they realise who Kaelan is.
However, the scientists are amazing. Through this experience I have come to realise the importance of
their work. I must thank the plumbers son who realised flushing the bacteria out
of a joint would aid in its recuperation. Even though Kaelan had to suffer his 
first operation to be cleansed in such a manner, I must say it seems to work!
I also feel humbled by the inventors of antibiotics. In fact, I am unsure where
modern treatment would be without them. A true life saver!
</p>
<p>
I jest not. Kaelan has become a statistic of modern medical survival.
One of the many millions who could (probably would) have died of their afflictions will 
(hopefully) survive because of the investment others have taken to look after 
their fellow humans.
It is for this reason that now-a-days the fragility of life can give the impression
of being less fragile. But how fragile it is. One day bouncing, the next, flat and punctured.
Thankyou. Thankyou for giving booboo another day.
</p>
<p>
Its hard to know what precisely happened. But it seems that
a bacterial infection behind the ear that Kaelan contracted a week and a half ago 
then infected his body (exhibited by scarlet fever), 
then moved to his hip joint. Ultimately, the swelling of his left thigh led me
to the conclusion that perhaps things had got of control. Thankfully the doctor agreed
with me and an appointment was made at St Heliers. The staff got to work
and have been helping booboo ever since. He is sleeping in a hospital bed as I type this but
most probably going to make it through to live another day.
</p>
<p>
Some more info from the net...
</p>
<p>
<code>
What is the outlook (prognosis) for septic arthritis?
</code>
</p>
<p>
<code>
If the infection is treated promptly, then there is a good chance of complete cure with no long term problems.
</code>
</p>
<p>
<code>
If there is delay in treatment, the infection can quickly destroy parts of the joint. 
This may lead to long term pain, reduced movement of the joint, 
and some disability. In some cases the infection becomes severe 
and leads to blood poisoning (septicaemia). This is a serious 
complication which can be fatal, but is now rare in the UK since antibiotics became available.
</code>
</p>
<p>
I think Kaelan is over the hump of this hill. I hope so. I could not take loosing him. 
Coming to terms with Nero is one thing. Coming to terms with Ruuskiis tick is another,....

Kaelan has scarlet fever. He is on penicillin, so will make it through. I hope.
</p>
<p>
This is all too much; Nero, a tick on Ruuskii, now pestilence in the house.

<hr>

Can't be too carefull. I'm not sure what I would do if anything happened to

Went to Legoland yesterday. 
<a href="../../imgs/2008/04/legoland/">Photos</a>.
</p>
<p>
There is a representation of Canary Wharf at Legoland and of course the HSBC building
has it Logo proudly displayed. Cannot say the same for the Citibank building. 
No Logo = no publicity. Idiots!
</p>
<p>
I am so HSBC, and proud of it!
</p>
<p>
However, I almost fell over when I saw one display. It was a view from the land of the hobbits!
Aparently Christendom once reached as far north as those burrows and an abbey was built in
Jedburgh. It soon fell into dis-repair, so not sure why its been included in Legoland?
They'd be better off with a view of Old Orpy. Aaah, Kaelan's true homeland.
</p>
<p>
Importantly, the manager of Legoland was very hospitable to the idea of having a
life size model of Nero being built and placed in a prime position. Poor Nero,
he would have enjoyed Legoland.

	Gentleman Like to Ride where he was thrown around.
	He was one of the five little teddies in the middle and had to lie 
	down at the end which he did and closed his eyes.
	Loved playing with the older children in the break who threw the 
	ball at Kaelan who threw the ball back.

I should have kept an hour by hour journal of Nero, when he was a puppy.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>24th Apr 2008</strong>
<p>
Even though yesterday was very upsetting, it kind of helps to finalise
Nero's passing. Though we still all miss you terribly.
</p>
<p>
But it is coming into summer and Nero would've wanted us to enjoy
all the new life that is popping up around us. Thank goodness Kaelan and
everyone else is around. But that is the end of the Clifford line, when you
think about it. No more kids for me.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>23rd Apr 2008</strong>
<p>
Very emotional day. I received Nero's ashes.
</p>
<p>
It brought memories back even more vividly.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>20th Apr 2008</strong>
<p>
Going for a walk today, in the woods on the other side of Epsom
where we used to take Nero.
</p>
<p>
Kaelan is walking quite a bit now. Not everytime, he still uses all fours for
propulsion. Took him to the swimming pool today. Of course, he did his 
obligatory sh*t.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>18th Apr 2008</strong>
<p>
I think I need to express my inner self.
</p>
<p>
<pre>
	The swimming tadpoles
	And fighting frogs,
	Peddling to get round.

	The pidgeon flying.
	The free-wheeling hawk.
	Feathers are everywhere.

	From nothing to life
	Then life to nothing.
	Cycles are all around.

	Cycles in the garden.
	Cycles in the house.
	Cycles are everywhere.
</pre>
</p>
<p>
I wish I could find a way of describing Nero's life properly. 
Here is a <a href="../../vids/myboxingday2006/nero.mpg">vid</a> from boxing day 2006.
He is so happy and beautiful.
</p>
<p>
Don't worry, I haven't forgotten about Kaelan, Ruuskii and Pasha.
Nero was the centre of the house, thats all.
</p>
<p>
And I haven't forgotten about my stomach either. I have no idea why it is expanding so much.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>15th Apr 2008</strong>
<p>
I cooked a chicken tonight but there was only Ruuskii to give the bones to.
He used to love them, his saliva would be seeping from the sides of his mouth.
Then after swallowing them whole he'd lick his lips, turn round, and lie down
to savour the taste.
</p>
<p>
Here is a <a href="../../vids/walk1.wmv">vid</a> 
of Kaelan walking before going on holiday and 
<a href="../../vids/walk2.wmv">one</a> after the hols.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>13th Apr 2008</strong>
<p>
I think going on holiday has helped a bit but nothing will be the same without
Nero. I think I may rename Kaelan. It doesn't seem quite right, I shout 'Nero'
and nothing happens.
</p>
<p>
He would want us to continue without him, I'm sure. So 
I will put up some photos of our recent holiday to Malta. Even 
though my heart is heavy, you my fans, expect to be updated with my
life events every day.

<strong>5th Apr 2008</strong>
<p>
Going to see Aunt Kaza today. Holidays won't be the same without Nero.
Even though he didn't always go, he was always there when I returned.
He used to groan and howl with delight when I returned.
</p>
<p>
Pasha is missing him terribly, as can be expected. They have been
together for all their lives. Kaelan is missing him. Nero was 
his cuddly teddy. Ruuskii is missing him like all dogs miss
there fellow pack members. His little heart is pining for Nero.
I hope we can all carry on. It is not easy. Everyday I have cried.
</p>
<p>
Sid and Nancy are here to look after the Epsom farm while we are away.
They were also sad to hear of Nero's passing.
</p>
<p>
Goodbye Nero, we will never stop loving and missing you.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>4th Apr 2008</strong>
<p>
I miss Nero so much. He was always around.
He was the perfect partner.
We had 14 years of being together and 
I will never forget his love and tenderness.
</p>
<p>
Goodbye Nero. I love you so much.
</p>

Goodbye Nero.

I had a vision that the hobbits came down and ransacked the Epsom farm!
While I was on holiday in Malta no less. I know they would do such a thing.
This is no April fool, they eye up my wine collection every time they visit.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>31st Mar 2008</strong>
<p>
Did I tell you I am going to Malta for a week next Saturday.
To see Aunt Kaza. I hope she is not too spaced out when we arrive.
I could do with her to be on her toes while we are there, I have many things
I want to do.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>30th Mar 2008</strong>
<p>
Vclear day today, can see from the Wembley Stadium up to Canary Warf. The
Epsom farm is very well situated for a panoramic view of London.
So much so, the hobbits almost wet themselves the first time they
visited. Talking of which I can sense a return.
</p>
<p>
If they appear, another charter will be drawn up for Sidney to adhere to.
</p>

Here is a message for Nancy from Kaelan:
</p>
<p>
<pre>
Hello Granny,

My Dad is crap, he never told me about your birthday until to today! 
Hope you have a great time and that the old toad Sid treats you to 
something special.

I will give you lots of hugs n kisses when I see you next.

Love, 

Kaelan.

Kaelan has been developing a naughty streak that I can only assume comes 
from the hobbit side. This is an example of his naughtiness: he's forgotton Nancy's birthday!
I'm sure she won't be very happy but I will wish her happy 70th for tomorrow!! 
And it is partly her fault anyway.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>23rd Mar 2008</strong>
<p>
Going to see Papa SOF today at his parents house.
He is a long standing fan and god father to Kaelan so
I thought I would grace his family with our presence.
</p>
<p>
Hope Kaelan behaves today.
</p>
<p>
Oh and it is snowing at the Epsom farm today. Well fluttering down
but not lying on the ground very deeply. Don't think I'll need to worry
about drifts on the drive.
</p>
<p>
Kaelan behaved, thankfully.

<p>
Went to see S&J today. Took Kaelan back to his proper roots,
in old Orpy. Went for meal at the Five Bells. Vnice indeed.
</p>
<p>
Kaelan was very grumpy through it all. Not sure what is the matter with him.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>21st Mar 2008</strong>
<p>
Kaelan is OK today. His rash has largely gone. So much so
we went to the Llama and Apaca farm in Ashurst Wood near Grinstead.
He was still a bit grumpy though.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>20th Mar 2008</strong>
<p>
<u>*NEWS FLASH*</u>
</p>
<p>
I took Kaelan to AnE this evening. I was terribly worried. I thought he 'd eaten
nettles or something. He was covered in this terrible rash. Luckily
my quick thinking stopped anything happening to my little boy.
You have to be on your toeseez to do this parenting lark, you know!
Just as well its me that looks after Kaelan and not that damn admin assistant,
he's so dim witted he'd never think to take him to hospital.
</p>
<p>
My baby Kaelan is ok and sleeping soundly upstairs at the moment. I'm 
just glad I look after him and make all the decisions.
</p>
<p>
Here is Kaelans report for today.

I AM PHENOMENAL!! 
</p>
<p>
"If only every one were as good as you, you are phenomenal!". Those were my bosses words
precisely. In fact I think he said 'phenomemal' 27 times during our conversation.
"I wish everyone thought like you. I wish every one was you!".
I don't know why I am surprised since this is what most people experience when they
deal with me anyway. But I thought my boss would be a harder nut to crack.
</p>
<p>
Well, glory heaped upon me once again. Praise is one then I can never get enough of.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>11th Mar 2008</strong>

Big meeting with the HSBC boss tomorrow. Got to get cracking with my project.... Not even started it.

I really should be an important historian or something. My knowledge is 
truley awesome. I could also be a fantastic musician, my timing is second to none.
Or I could easily be a model, for obvious reasons, or I could be a, an, anything, acutally. I am amazing.
</p>
<p>
Enough about me.
</p>
<p>
No matter how fantastic I am I really wish I knew what to do with Nero.
He is getting on, you know.
I don't want him to suffer but I don't want him to go too early either.
We are best buddies. Is there a way to tell? I mean, if I really knew life was getting too
much for him and I knew he didn't want to go on, I would do what I would hope he would do to me.
As I say, I am pretty amazing but I guess I don't have much control over how the end of me might
come about. It might get messy.
If things get too bad when I am 138 years old, I hope someone will say to me would you rather be alive or dead? Hopefully I will have
enough motor and cognative ability to say what I think. 
And if I say I'd rather not carry on, ideally there will
be a humane way of extinguishing my life.
But this is the paradox. If I was to get too old and out
of it then 
I wouldn't be able to say anything and I'd live a to the end of my days as a living corpse. 
But if I was able to 
say anything I'd probably think I was doing ok and be disappointed that you wanted to kill me!
Realistically, 
I could live to be 200 or so years old (I have a lot of things to do!!). 
However, I have the abiltiy to chose when Nero's time comes. 
So I ask you; 
</p>
<ul><li>
why does he still want to play with his ball? 
</li><li>
Why does he enjoy being pandered by me and Kaelan?
</li><li>
Why does he enjoy his food so much? 
</li><li>
Why does he love being around other people/dogs so much? 
</li><li>
Why does he not give the impression of not wanting to live?
</li><li>
Why does he not give up? And let me know he's given up?
</li></ul>
<p>
This is the hardest thing I will ever have to do in my life and when 
the time comes I hope Nero knows I will be doing it out of love.

Eventually made it to LZ's yesterday. L from 'ell's driving leaves nothing to be desired. Talk about wheel
spins! 
</p>
<p>
A jolly time was had by <a href="../../imgs/2008/03/northhamptonandfrogs/">all</a>. 
Kaelan's appetite was truly amazing, he ate enough for 4 children. 
</p>
<p>
I was rather alarmed by what I thought was a frog fight in the pond this morning. However, I realised
they were just getting frisky. Ah nature! Always a surprise around the corner.
</p>
<p>
Also, as one would expect Kaelan got me a Mothers Day card. I am a truly amazing
mum and fortunately Kaelan sees that. I do feel sorry for the rest of the mums in the 
world, especially Nancy. I mean, would you want a card from the admin assistant?
No doubt that imbecile forgot. Oh well, I will wish her a happy mothers day for him.

HAPPY MOTHERS DAY NANCY!! YOU REALLY DREW THE SHORT STRAW!

I used to be against the death penalty for henious crimes. Now I am less so.

<p>
If we were to weigh up the odds against how many innocent get killed through
incorrectly being blamed for a murder and those who might be saved through having a 
death penalty in place. Then perhaps we could substantiate bringing it back.
</p>
<p>
Importantly I'm pro making the victims families
feel better. If they want a good 'anging then let em 'ang, thats what I say.

I will teach Kaelan all my wisdom.

Must go to the doctors today... I am feeling rather strange at the moment.
I think I have been eating too much cheese since I am having dreams  
where I have been swimming with Nero in a beautiful lake high up in the Alps.
After we've finished we lie on a green grassed bank basking in the sun.
Then I feel a wriggling in my stomach and a tadpole pops out through my
belly button and says "Oi! Whatchaplayinat?!". Then he hops back down to the lake.
I'm startled by all this since I'm not in the habit of eating tadpoles 
and wake up in a fuzz. vConfused. But the funny thing is the 
wriggling continues in my stomach, after I'm awake. 
So I will challenge the doctor on two counts: 1. why am I having such dreams 2.
what is the wriggling!
</p>
<p>
Oh and my belly is not shrinking either. I will mention that as well.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>20th Feb 2008</strong>
<p>
Kaelan's latest developments are to point and shout. At anything! 
Sometimes I do not think he knows what is the object of 
his pointing or indeed shouting. But he will continue to 
partake in these activities for quite some minutes.
He is also loosing things under
the sofa, all the time. Though it is very cute when 
he tries to get things out from under there. Balls, balls, balls.
Any kind of ball fascinates him at the moment. Golf, tennis, football,
furry, bowling, plastic, any kind. He can't get enough of them.
Nero's tennis ball is not the most hygenic I suspect, but that is 
Kaelan's favourite! Importantly, Nero is good at sharing. Nero has also picked up
a bit. The vet changed his tablets a few weeks ago and they didn't help at all.
Nero is back on his old ones and wants to play again.
</p>
<p>
The admin assistant said he passed an exam at the weekend. Which exam? Was it hard?
Who cares!

Kaelan had a poo in the pool today. Perhaps last weeks incident may have been 
him as well. So why did Nancy look so guilty? Yes, she did it last week and
today is his first time. But how embaressing... first Nancy and now Kaelan.

Also, went to Bockett farm today. Saw some pigs, piglets, sheep, lambs and
cows and calves.

I have a sister. She thinks she 'knows' me. 
However, I know better, but to keep her delusional tendencies 
happy I am going to post her recent rants to me. 
Make of them what you will. She is a crazed woman after all (and she doesn't know what paragraphs are):
</p>
<p>
<code style="color: blue;">
Astrid said I should watch the video on her blog entitled Apology.
It was very interesting but quite difficult to understand  could you perhaps include English subtitles?
Im not quite sure where these Hobbit fellows are from  maybe they are Polish immigrants as Ive heard there are a lot in England now. I think the chap she calls the admin assistant might also be from Poland as he speaks in the same way. Quite an affable chap, despite his lack of English. Astrid says hes a slacker, but he seemed to be doing a wonderful job with Kaelan and the dogs.
Also, I must write to exonerate poor Nancy Hobbit The floater in the swimming pool was definitely not from her - it was my sister Astrid. She used to do the same thing in the bath when we was younger. I would be merrily soaping myself down when I would see these great steaming
turds racing downstream towards me! That, and the fact that I had to wipe her bottom until she was about 16, is the reason I am unable to change a nappy. I have been advised by eminent psychologists that doing so could bring back terrible childhood memories and trigger an incurable relapse. So, c'mon cock! Own up! The floater was yours!

Some of the non-native english speakers amongst you struggled to understand

Vid team: 	Excuse-me, Astrid can you listen to Sid please.
Sid:		I, Sid Hobbit offer a PROFOUND apology for my 
		misdemeanours on Friday evening. On bended knees please 
		graciously pardon me.
Astrid:		Do you want a response now?
Sid:		Well please.
Astrid:		Well, Sidney Hobbit I have been very disappointed with
		your conduct on previous visits.
Sid:		Och.
Astrid:		But you have redeemed yourself to some extent this time.  
		So to see whether a hobbit can really change its spots we
		will allow you one more visit, to see how you conduct 
		yourself.
Vid team:	Are you happy?
Sid:		Thank you very much.
Astrid:		You may kiss my feet.

Took Kaelan and the hobbits swimming today. Everything was going swimmingly
until a spot of poo was noticed near us (me, Kaelan and Nancy) in the pool. Of course I rushed
Kaelan out thinking he had had a little accident but it wasn't until we got into the changing
rooms that the truth dawned. Kaelan had a clean nappy, not a spot of poo anywhere but 
Nancy had disappeared straight to the loos! It was then I noticed a dribble of excrement heading off in
the Ladies direction that I realised it must have been her. Oh how embarrasing! 
She had probably tried to slip
a fart out but it had followed through! 
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, Sid has made much progress this visit. He largely complied with the charter 
as published previously. Though he "forgot" to put Kaelan to bed one evening which
obviously brought him in breach of the charter but to show his regret he offered a PROFOUND 
<a href="../../vids/apology.wmv">apology</a>.
</p>
<p>
Importantly they are leaving today. Though I am sad to see them go, sometimes when things
come to an end there is a sigh of relief. Tonight, when the dust has settled I will have
a glass of wine and a rather large sigh.
</p>
<p>
The first daffodil of spring has appeared at the farm. It is a good sign.

Went to Brighton today. The hobbits were nervous to travel even farther away from their
burrow in Hobawick than they aready are, 
but I convinced them that it was only a short distance and that 
I would buy them an ice-cream once they arrived. This subdued their frightened protests.
</p>
<p>
vBeautiful weather graced us and we had a stroll along the promenade and the pier.
I bought Kaelan his first windmill which amused him immensely.
We had fish and chips by the beach, vnice fish, I must say.
Also, the admin assistant and Sid disappeared for half and hour and came back 
smelling of alcohol. I am suspicious of this.
</p>
<p>
On the way home we stopped at one of the hobbits friend's burrows. I am slighty worried
since it seems they are proceating this far south, in my fair old England.
Though the young one was very sweet I think new legislation should be brought in to halt 
their spread southwards.

Sid's <a target="_blank" href="../../imgs/sidcharter.png">charter</a>.
He better abide by it or he is out!

I suspect some hobbits will arrive soon. This is not a major problem as long 
as they all muck in. If Nana Nancy arrives that will be ok. She has useful
skills which can be utilised. However, 
if Sid Hobbit bumbles through the door some rules will have to be 
laid out. I think I will get my legal team to draft out a charter 
that he will have to sign and abide to. 
If he is going to stay more than 2 mins that is.
</p>
<p>
Also, Sir David Attenborough is very inspiring. So much so I am thinking about
writing a book on these hobbit creatures. It shall be called "The Habits of 
the Hobawick Hobbits". I am unsure what humanity will glean from these creatures
but that is the job of an animal behaviouralist to discover! 
I am up to the challenge!

Took Nero and Ruuskii to the downs today. I instructed the admin assistant to walk behind 
with Nero but Nero insisted on catching up. He is an old dog with a big heart (Nero, that is,
the admin assistant is just old).
Walking now is not too easy for him and he doesn't like to be away from my side.
The vet gave me some pills. They will hopefully make his remaining time
more pleasant. I do not know what I will do when the time comes. He is my friend, guardian
and hero all rolled into one. It makes me upset just thinking about it.
</p>
<p>
Ruuskii chases anything that moves. He tried to catch a greyhound today. 
I really believe he thought he stood a chance. The greyhound only needed to break 
into a canter and was clean away.
</p>
<p>
Kaelan sat in his pram, quite the thing.
</p>
<p>
I was regal. As always.

My tum has returned with avengence. I really do not know what to do to get rid of it.
I know as you get older it gets harder to shift the flab but I have never 
gained so much weight when I have been dieting. I must go to the doctors to
find out what is wrong. No doubt my thyroid is working overtime, or something. Or
is it underworking? I can never remember.
</p>
<p>
I mean one month without having a drink! So what? The admin assistant does amuse himself.

As you know, I have started back at work again. This would normally leave Kaelan home alone. 
However, I had the
bright idea of getting someone to look after him while I am out.
Luckily the person I have found seems to do a good job and writes a report of Kaelans activities every
day. Here is one such 'report':
</p>
<p>
<pre><center>Kaelan 28/01/2008</center>

	bottle of milk at 2.30pm

	<u>Activities</u>
	Enjoyed playing with Jamies Socatots football. Kaelan is 
	very goood at throwing!! 
	
</pre>
</p>
<p>
So, what does one make of that? Kaelan's ball skills seem to be good, as attested by
the report and the vid I posted on Sunday. Kaelan also enjoys a varied diet at home
and at the child carers. 
</p>
<p>
Lastly, I would just like to say Kaelan gets his bowel habits from the hobbit side
of the family (specifically Sid).

The admin assistant had a good idea today. His first one. He bought
Kaelan a football! Kaelan really loves it. See the 
<a href="../../vids/football.wmv">vid</a>.
</p>

<strong>24th Jan 2008</strong>
<p>
Kaelan stood and balanced without any aid today! He was hitting the admin assistants leg
with a skittle, then took the free hand away but kept on hitting! For at least 20-30 seconds!!
It was quite amazing.
</p>
<p>
How do I get another child without a viable donor? I need to be vcreative. 
Need to think outside the box. Realistically Nero is still the best bet.

If I were looking for a meaningful relationship, my partner would have to be good at DIY.
That is the most important thing. Honesty, intergrity, failfulness, sincerity
are a distant second/third/etc.. respectively. 
DIY is important for the proper running of a household.
Very few men have the skills required to make it to 'the' standard that I insist on.
</p>
<p>
I mean, what is one to do when one wants ones chandelier put up?
</p>
<p>
My tum is finally shrinking, phew!! Not by much though.
</p>

It would be interesting for Aunt Kaza to go to the land of the hobbits. I think
it would be quite an education for her. It was for me, the first time I went there.
I felt like David Attenborough. Aunt Kaza would get on with Sid, I'm sure. 
Their love of cheese would give them a conversation point. Hmmm, however, realisitically
I do not think Aunt Kaza would understand a word.
</p>
<p>
Nero is farting a lot today.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>18th Jan 2008</strong>
<p>
Happy Birthday Aunt Kaza!! Nearly 50 but still young at heart.
</p>
<p>
The similarities between Aunt Kaza and Sid do extend further than
not doing their fair share of chores. They both eat cheese.
And generally it is cheese from my fridge!! 
Stilton, mature cheddar, camembert, brie, goats, younameit.  My fridge can be creaking 
when they arrive but when they leave, they strangely have aquired the creak.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>17th Jan 2008</strong>
<p>
Yes, you are correct. Aunt Kaza and Sid have similarities. Neither change nappies. Though
Sid has changed number 1 nappies under duress. I think he is still a shirker. Aunt Kaza kind
of makes up for her nappy inadequicies with her attempts at cooking. 
</p>
<p>
In fact, Nana Nancy
is probably the most willing nappy changer.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>15th Jan 2008</strong>
<p>
Aunt Kaza is leaving today. She hasn't changed a nappy so I am not too sad to see her go.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>14th Jan 2008</strong>
<p>
Aunt Kaza seems appreciative of what the admin assistant does in the office, and for 
Kaelan, Nero and Ruuskii. Is she mad? He is useless! I could expect much more
from him. But I have given up. 
</p>
<hr>
<strong>12th Jan 2008</strong>
<p>
Aunt Kaza is here! We went to Whitstable, to the 
<a href="../../imgs/2008/01/whitstable/">beach</a>.
A bit chilly but Kaza enjoyed the briskness of it all. A big temp difference from Malta.
Aunt Kaza says the most ridiculous things, she said I used to eat my food like a dog! She used to
cut the meat up and put it on a plate on the floor and I'd eat it. I mean, its like all the 
other rubbish she comes out with.
</p>
<p>
Nero enjoyed himself, chased stones along the beach. Also, even though he is struggling to walk, he has
no fear. He gave a growl to an even bigger alsation than him that got a bit too close! Go Nero, he would
never see me get hurt.
</p>
<p>
Kaelan was cute, of course. And my tum is not shrinking! Will have to start doing sit-ups.
</p>

<strong>10th Jan 2008</strong>
<p>
Feeling 100% aok now. I don't think I have had flu for so long before. Usually it only lasts
for a day or so.
</p>
<p>
Also, started back at work at HSBC. It must be done, I suppose. I will no doubt 
rejuvenate insurance training in the UK with my usual pizazz.
</p>
<p>
Even though I had flu for three weeks, I have acquired a festive tum. It is not removing itself
easily either. I shall go on a diet for a week or two. Soon be back to trim young me!
</p>
<p>
Poor Nero is struggling at the moment. His back legs are getting very weak. So he has been getting treated 
to fresh meat to build up his strength, everyday.
</p>
<hr>
<strong>5th Jan 2008</strong>
<p>
Feeling a bit better today.
</p>
<p>
Kaelan has progressed loads. He can now wave goodbye/hello. He can say 'ta' 
(a rudimentry way of say thankyou, as espoused by the hobbits and the admin assitant).
Though, in reality he copies these actions, parrot fashion. 
I'm not 100% convinced he understands what he is doing. But anyway, progress, I feel.
</p>
<p>
No luck adopting a baby. These people want references and things! I mean, don't they 
know who I am?
</p>
<p>
When I say Kaelan says 'ta', sometimes it may be 'da', or 'ka', or 'thna'. Usually it 
is a single syllabel though. But often it isn't.
</p>

<strong>1st Jan 2008</strong>
<p>
The snow drops are arriving in the garden. The primroses are showing signs
of waking up. My, how the years passing make me appreciate the gentler things in life.
</p>
<p>
Happy New Year!! To all my fans. 
</p>
<p>
My new year resolution is to find Kaelan a brother or sister. Think I will adopt
one. Even though, realistically, another child of mine would be preferable I can
not find a suitable "donor". What colour should they be? Which continent will
I search? Oh, I am so like Madge and Joli it makes me smile.
