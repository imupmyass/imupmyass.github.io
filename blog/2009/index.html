Hopes are fading of a pre-2010 departure. I think the hobbits are here for the long-haul. Oh, what kind of new year shall we have? A debauched smelly epoch that will damage everyone I am sure.
<br><br>
S&J came round last night and witnessed the debacle first hand. Poor things, they were quite ruffled by the end of the evening. They were being polite when they said yes to the hobbits request to partake in a game of dominos. As always these things start polite enough but as usual things turned dirty, quickly. I have never seen so much cheating.
<p />
Aden now makes a sound for "please". He also said "dada" today while looking at the admin assistant.
I have no idea why.

There have been ups and downs over the last 5 or 6 days. However, everyone has come out alive.
Nancy's gruel is finally finished, but I think she is planning her next batch and what is worse,
Sidney is going to be involved in its creation. He will have to scrub his paws with a wire brush before I let 
him in the kitchen.
<p />
Roll on 2010. Or is hoping that they will leave before the new year too much?

Oh the disgrace of it all. Sid tried to get in bed with me last night! He tried to get his Christmas goodies
early but do not worry, he was promptly kicked where even the male of the hobbit species feels it most.
Dirty scoundrel. He muttered something about getting lost looking for the toilet but I know this Sidney
better than he thinks. Oh the thought of it makes my skin crawl.
<p />
Merry Christmas! This morning = busy, <a href="../../imgs/2009/12/25/">busy</a>.

There is a continual air of chaos when the hobbits are around. And they are getting rounder!
Sid is a guzzler and Nancy knows no bounds. 
<p />
Went to Denbys today, an English vineyard. The hobbits tried to roll the barrels out of the premises.
How embarressing. 
<p />
One day to go till the big day. I hope it goes ok, however
I will remain regal through it all, even if everyone else does not.
<p />
Nancy has made some gruel for us. It looks like some kind of primitive soup. How I dread its appearance
in front of me.

Nancy's gruel is like the kiss of life to us Hobbits. 
And it was so easy to break through their so-called defences - 
like taking candy from a baby!

For 24 hours the Epsom farm withstood their onslaught but in the end it fell to the hobbits persistance. They
breached the defenses at approximately 3am last night. It was bloody and dirty, and I do not believe any
amount of armament could have stopped them, for they were sneaky. They entered the inner complex via the 
sewers! Of all the dirty rotten tricks. Why did I not think of that weakness?
Like rats they came up through my favourite toilet bowl. Oh I am exhausted,
and I have to admit defeat, for the first time in my life a lesser form of life has out smarted me. 
<p />
The sad reality is that Kaelan has taken to them. Aden doesn't seem to mind them though his expression
the first time he saw them again this morning said it all.
<p />
With tears in my eyes, I know all my festive plans are scuppered and the cleaning team are
still trying to wipe Sid and Nancy's shitty paw marks off of my best china bowl. 
<p />
Where is the vodka? Ahhhhhhhhhhhh, Nancy has drunk it 
all already. Where is my shotgun?

The kids and Ruuskii are excited, the snow is falling and the logs (proverbial) are on the
fire. Think I might put my slippers on.
<p />
The finishing touches to the defense and intruder system were completed today. I feel safe
in my castle. No hairy oiks his year. No way.

Yesterday evening I asked my boys who had done a poo, since there was definitely an
odour lingering around them. Before I had finished my sentence both of them had fingers pointing at
each other trying to apportion blame. In the end it was Kaelan who was the culprit, and 
he calls himself an "angel boy"!

I am unsure of the au pair's claims that Aden said "please" yesterday. She is Johny foreigner, so 
everything she says has to be taken with a pinch of salt.

You can see why I will not allow the hobbits

Today Aden started saying "no". He has became most proficient in its use in only a few hours. If only his brother could grasp the significance of the word "please" so quickly. I have been trying to impress upon Kaelan`s young mind the pre-requisite of manners, perhaps for at least a year, and nothing seems to penetrate. I may visit the local blacksmiths and get the word branded on his skull, for I am sick of repeating it to him. I am looking for solutions, so if anyone knows of an answer, please let me know.<br><br>No. <br><br>How simple and beautiful.<br><br>Please.<br><br>What&#096;s so difficult?

Kaelan has picked up a habbit of calling a bottle a "boh-il". Disgusting. He has picked
it up from the admin assistant, I am sure. I shall ban that linguistically corrupt man from ever speaking
to my children again if Kaelan doesn't start saying bottle with a sharp, clear "T" sound by this evening.
<p />
Aden is fluent in his own language at the moment. He can say "yeh" for "yes" but 
that is about all the english I can understand. I am unsure 
if it is the admin assistants influence that inhibits Aden's progress.

One incident I can accept, but two? The nursery Aden attends had to fill out another

Though I think you will see this was no accident. Aden was attacked! I am not one for suing but
I have called my lawyer and he is searching the legal cases to see if there is a president!
And what is this treatment of a damned Cold Compress and TLC. It sounds like something the hobbits would
administer to their off-spring!

Kaelan&#096;s imagination is really running riot at the moment. 
He can pluck blueberrys from fresh air and put them in his pocket to give to his friends later. 
He see&#096;s fireworks explode where there is nothing but an empty room. 
Some raisins placed in a line become a train and carriage, an edible one of course. 
The whole world seems to be a mixing pot of Dali like paintings. 
Objects mix and merge and there seems to be no limit to the possibile outcomes of how 
they are interpreted and assimilated by Kaelans mind.

It is that time of year again, up with the Christmas tree!! Kaelan helped of course, but Aden was a little too enthusiatic with the decorations and had to be entertained elsewhere.
<br>
<br>It is that time of year again where the defenses around the Epsom farm have to be strengthened. The (de)fences are being raised 12 feet above and below ground with anti-cutting and gnawing wire. I have received permission from the local council to build a 20 foot wide mote around the house, it shall be 10 feet deep at all stretches. I would like to put piranha in it but I would be concerned should Ruuskii fall in. 
<br>
<br>Why all this effort to keep my family safe? I am under no illusion how much effort those beastly hobbits will make to be with me and my children at Christmas. I am even thinking of purchasing some surface-to-air missiles from the Russians, just in case Nancy tries to use Sidneys stomach as a trampoline to catapult herself over the barbed wire. They have suprised me before, BUT NOT THIS YEAR!! 
<br>
<br>I have also asked my Technology Team to make sure the hobbits cannot breach our internet security. I have no idea how they would do it, but I am sure those hobbits could burrow through the internet and get into my house that way! They are conniving creatures you know.

Kaelan made an interesting observation about today. He said "From this day forth, Aden will
always be more than 50% of my age as long a we both live". Now, that is an interesting statement on two counts: 
<br> 1. 
Aden is the same
age today as Kaelan was when Aden was born, to the day! How did Kaelan know that?
<br> 2. I wasn't aware Kaelan was
aware of his own (or his brothers) mortality. Were you? That is quite amazing, for one so young.

Other events for today include:

Aden had a small incident yesterday. The nursery

but when I asked my medical team what a cold compress and T.L.C. were, they were stumped! Any ideas? Luckily
Aden seems none the worse for wear.
<p />
Also, Kaelan has started making medical observations. He proclaimed today, quite convincingly, that he 
had a sore stomach and that the only thing that could help his predicament was chips! What do you make of that?
He is quite knowledgable for one so young.

Kaelan has a naughty mouth, he was stuffing it full of food, but it bit his finger and upset him loads.

I think I was more worried than Kaelan about his little teddy&#096;s whereabouts but eventually teddy turned up. Well, I should say I went looking for him and found him in a wood on the Downs!<br><br>Aden is really into pressing buttons at the moment. Any kind will do, especially those connected to the oven.

Thomas. 
<br>
<br>You know I think it was kind of inevitable, but my boys being boys are fascinated by Thomas the Tank engine. Strangely, the admin assistant informed me that Kaelan&#096;s Great Great Grandfather was called Thomas and that Sidney&#096;s middle name is also Thomas. He then proceeded to get very excited by the connection between his Great Grandfather&#096;s name and steam engines. However, I can reliably inform you that the admin assistants Great Grandfather was not called, as he believes, Thomas Whistle, it was in fact Thomas Bell! He is too much of an idiot, that damn admin assistant. 
<br>
<br>Importantly, there is no connection between Aden and this line of... oh, how does one describe them. He is a miracle of me.

That admin assistant says he went to college and did a degree
in Fine Art. To be honest I do not believe he is 
educated beyond kindergarten however I do believe the only thing he could study is art, since there 
is no studying involved. He is a lazy good for nothing torag. The worst thing is, he persuaded
some 
<a href="../../imgs/2009/10/04/">women</a>
 of certain age to lie for him yesterday and to say that he was a great student! He is a bone idler
and I do not believe he has picked up a paint brush to paint a wall, never mind a painting.
One of ladies was convinced he had attended the college where she worked in he mid nineties.
But listen to this! She said one painting he did had been inspired by him spitting down a stairwell!!
It makes me sick to think of him wasting tax payers money. The other woman ranted on about his lyrical, poetic
painting. They were both insane, I am sure of it.
<p />
A good painting involves having skill which can represent trees and hills that look life-like. Anything else is balerdash.

Aden is a tricky customer, one minute he is breathing fine, the next he isn&#096;t. So I took him to hospital yesterday and he stayed in overnight. Better safe than sorry, that&#096;s what I say. A chest infection, not a nice thing for a one year old. However, the doctors and nurses did a good job and with a bag full of medicine he is home today. We all think he is over the worst, I hope he is. My little boobdee.<br><br>Kaelan is another fighter. He will fight the bed-time fatigue like his life depends on it. 7:30pm and he is slouched like a semi-retired scarecrow against the sofa. "Do you want to go to bed?" No, he shakes his head. If he shakes it too hard, I swear it will fall off. Straw is not very strong you know.

For Kaelan, everything is funny at the moment. "Look at that funny stone", he in says in histerics pointing to a pebble on the path. "Look at the funny blackberry", he says almost weeing himself. "Look at the funny...", you name it, and it is funny at the moment. If I didn`t know better I`d say he was a regular user of recreational drugs. 
<br>
<br>Aden refuses to understand what "no" means. He will not give up on trying to get what he wants. I think he must get that from me. My resoluteness is known through out the civilised (and uncivilised) world.
<br>
<br>Went to a party yesterday. It was J&#096;s of S&J&#096;s birthday. Jolly good fun to see all the old biddys again. Kaelan enjoyed dancing with S, and Aden wriggled all day. The admin assistant played cricket but obviously doesn&#096;t understand the gentlemanly rules of not catching out the birthday boy.
<br>
<br>Also, and I am really not quite sure what to make of this, a male friend said that he thought the admin assistant was quite handsome! I really do not know what to say.

I must qualify my previous statement: the Clifford line is a tough one. Times were hard but my father Douglas

Aden is moving towards walking, but not especially quickly. He is quite happy to take
a couple of steps when prompted but then dive to the cover of the floor when he realises what he is doing.
However, when he isn't aware of what he is doing he is quite happy to take 4-8 steps. 
Importantly, he is my booboo. So what ever he does, and when ever he does it, is ok with me.
<p />
Also, I've recently had a fraulin kraut working for me. However, do not misunterstand me. I find
krauts quite agree-able (for I am half krautish after all). The sickening thing is, is that she had a fling
with Sidney!! Can you believe it? One day I found them naked in the garden. They denied everything of course,
but I know hobbits and krauts quite well (unfortunately), and I especially know when they are lying. Dirty dogs.
Could you imagine it? A krautish hobbit. Oh, how bizarre.

My boys can be naughty. Today we were on the Epsom Downs and Aden and Kaelan were in the double buggy. Two beautiful Huskis came along and I stopped to admire them. Before I knew it, the buggy had toppled over and my boys were bloodied and stained. Oh it always happens so quickly, and it seems Aden always comes off the worse. Today he ad a big red patch on his forehead, a scrape on his nose, blood oozing from his mouth and a lump on his chin. Do not worry, a couple of wild black berrys later and he was ok, but boys are trouble you know!

Don`t ask. But we are in Jersey. We came by ferry. For a holiday, I think.<br><br>The journey here from Poole was horrendous. Oh what a rocky sea we rode. When we arrived in Guernsey, stopping on our way to Jersey, the embarking passengers grimaced, "what a smell of puke". The ship thoroughly stank of sick by that point in journey. Most of it came from Kaelan and Aden. They wretched their little stomachs up. First Kaelan, then Aden, then me. Oh dear, I get quite lightheaded thinking about the experience. I do not believe Hell is any worse than what we went through. For three hours I was sure we were all finished and that our lives would end, drowning in a sea of vomit. Oh, then when I thought it was all over, we all found extra reserves of slime and spit from our stomachs and started wrenching again. No. No No. No. <br><br>We have recovered now. Thank goodness. But I will never forget the spray of Adens first puke shooting over me, kaelan, the admin assistant, and the furnishings and passengers in the near vacinity. Kaelan was in shock, he had never been in a war zone before, for it was a war zone, the other passengers were falling left, right and centre. Like staggering wounded hero`s, retreating from the trenches. There was no escape from the madness. Heave, ho, heave ho. First the boat, then our stomachs. Heave, ho, heave ho. The toilets were over-flowing over with the ex-contents of our deepest intestines. Gruesome.<br><br>I would like to say there was an intrinsic comedy in the scene. But no, I nearly died, as did my family. The 19th of July 2009 will go down in history as the day I nearly lost my family, something akin to the Somme 1916. I expect to receive an award from somebody soon, just for surviving and pulling my family through it all.

Yipee!! Aden took his first unaided first steps today! Between me and the admin assistant. 
Well, to be accurate, I coaxed and cajoled Aden towards the admin assistant,
then Aden turned round and ran towards me. Who can blame him?
Well done Aden! 1 year, 1 week and 1 day. I like that. 4 years earlier than the admin assistant!!
I think I was walking by 3 months though.
<p />
Kaelan was unphased by it all. The way he was watching the sensational moments of Aden's life were like "is
that the best you can do?". Anyway,
Kaelan's favourite toys since we went
to Biggin Hill are aeroplanes and helicopters. Everything is "Red Arrows" at the moment, even coat hangers. 
I suspect Kaelan will be flying solo by the time he is three.

Yipee!! Aden is 1 today!!! He is the cutest boy ever (well, him and Kaelan are equal of course. And to be 
honest perhaps Nero was cuter than both of them. Ruuskii isn't as cute as Nero (or pashee) I'm afraid. He is my little boy
as well of course but on the cute stakes Nero wins. Paws down). Aden had a relaxing day, enjoyed a 
birthday doughnut
and snoozed. How time flies. He is developing similarly to Kaelan. I am hoping he will be 
walking unaided soon. My boys (all of them) have a rapport. Definitely. Sometimes good, sometimes not so good
but they are growing up every day (apart from Ruuskii, who can be just down right naughty).
Aden is not naughty, though he puts up a fight when I take him up-stairs. He thinks
he is getting put to bed. Which, even though he is tired, he struggles and protests against.
He has an attitude at times which reminds me of the admin assistant. Luckily, there is no connection, for 
Aden is mine, all mine.

It's been a poo-ee week so far. On Monday Aden had an episode in the bath. Actually, not
only in the bath but on the bathroom floor as well. Then he continued to poo as
he crawled into the bedroom. Finally, as he turned around to come back to the bathroom he
started smearing through trail he had left. Oh it really was a disaster.
<p />
On a positive note, Kaelan successfully did his first potty poo today!! Yippeeeee! He is such a good boy. 
Nancy screamed encouragement as  Kaelan prepared for his special moment: "guanyersellweeman" she bellowed.
I assume it was encouragement, since I do not know what she was saying, but she was very excited.
Importantly for Kaelan, I think seeing Sidney doing his poo's squatting
at the bottom of the garden helped him get the gist of what to do.

Aunt Kaza and I are going to make a vid. Perhaps a Wham song, or a scene from Shakespeare?

Such culture is lost on the hobbits of course. 
<p />
I am introducing such things as asparagus to them but 
you can visibly see their little snouts turn up at the prospect of being given something that 
did not die a bloody death or wasn't truffled up from at least 1 foot below the surface of the forest floor!
<p />
What's more, I am sure they are at it in their bedroom of an evening! The thunderous noises are either... oh I cannot

I think I know why Sid and Nancy (and Lydia, last year) win money on the the horses. It is because 
hobbits are so much closer genetically to horses! I mean, they are almost horses. For example, notice their dopey 
eyes and persistantly runny noses. Bingo! They must be of the same genus as horses and donkeys.
That explains alot but not everything. Why are they so fat? Ah, I know. They must be closer to donkeys than horses.
Have you ever seen a donkeys belly? Just like a barrel. Vsimilar to Sidney's. Yes, donkeys it is.

Kaelan and Aden loved the steam trains and watching all the animals in the fields as
we trundled along. Think I might be a bit of a train spotter, really enjoyed jotting down all
the numbers of the trains that I saw. My grandfather made model trains, think I must get it from him. 
Nana Nancy reminisced about the days when there was a train line going through Hobawick.
I sincerley doubt such engineering ever made it so far north but she seemed adamant.
She talked about when her and Sidney were courting and went up to Hobinburgh to buy a ring for 
their engagement. When I say ring, it was of the type that would go through their noses.

<p />
Kaelan has picked up a rather irritating habit: he never shuts up. I mean never. 
There is constant monologue of lifes mundane events just after they have happened. All the time, from when he awakes
to when he falls asleep. I am starting to think he may be suited to journalism
(though he doesn't lie), or a historian (though he doesn't make things up) or the like.

Aden started crawling today. In a straight line and forwards. Previously he had 
made attempts at "moving" but they were in random directions and with limited success. Today, however
he has cracked it. He crawls like he has one dead leg but when Kaelan started it was like he had two!
<p />
Sid and Nancy left today, unfortunately they didn't bring the cable down for their box browning so I have 
been unable to get photos onto the web. Perhaps they will send some down?

I am ran ragged by these creatures! Did I tell you the hobbits Sid and Nancy arrived a couple of days ago? I am too polite. I should ask them to leave since they arrived unannounced but they would only start squealing and throwing themselves on the floor until I rescinded.<br><br>I was hoping Aden wouldn&#096;t take to these unshaven beasts quite as much as Kaelan has, but Sidney just needs to walk into the room and Aden is in fits of laughter. Nancy however, is a different kettle of fish. Aden looks at her with a certain wariness. I think he knows that she will bite if provoked. Actually, Kaelan was bitten by Nancy! He will be scarred for life. She tried to say that she was remonstrating Sidney but the whole house just about fell down with her vicious wraith. No wonder Ruuskii is having nightmares.<br><br>Please, please, please... Nero, I need you....

The admin assistant has been given a reference by his current (secondary) employers, it 
goes like this:
<font color="darkblue"><pre>
	To Whom it may concern,
	
	The admin assistant has been with us now for 2 years and has been 
	a joy to work with. He is a very capable engineer and I think he 
	will be an excellent addition to your company.
	
	He picks up new technology very quickly and has gone from being a 
	good engineer to an enterprise class engineer in a relatively short 
	period of time, during his time here he has achieved VCP status 
	from VMware, CCNA from Cisco, EqualLogic SAN qualified and has 
	helped us implement ISO27001 security accreditations across our 
	internal systems and data centres.
	
	The admin assistant is an excellent team player and is more than 
	capable of working on his own and is well respected by his peers and 
	colleagues alike. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the admin assistant
	to you and we are sad to see him leave.
	
	His final basic salary is approximately 15.20p
	
	Yours Sincerely
	
	Alan Gill
	Professional Services Director
</pre></font>
Yes, this is an April fool. The (secondary) company he works for are glad (not sad) to see him leave.
<p />
Aden, on the other hand, is almost crawling. He can also move along, very precariously,
some objects while standing. It's not quite walking the furniture, but not far off!

Happy birthday NANCY! From Kaelan and Aden, and me, most importantly.
Sidney has treated her to a day in the woods. She can search for juicy root tubers all she wants. I can sense her
happiness as she rummages through the undergrowth sniffing out the elusive Thornwood Truffle.

May I take this opportunity to remind people that it is very rude to make excuses for not sending people cards at the appropriate time of year. I never forget my friends and family&#096;s important dates, but some of YOU are not quite as particular. Please take this as a gentle reminder to pull your fingers out.<br><br>By the way of showing you what I mean, it is Nana Nancy&#096;s 104th birthday on the 28th of this month. So please send her birthday cards, to make her feel special. I know the admin assistant has probably forgotten. So if you see him, give him a thump.

Aah, what an easy life I have. Been up to London town two days on the trot. I&#096;ve left the booboos with the child minder. I think she feels quite privileged to have them.

Aden has had an operation. In fact he had two operations, one for each nostril. 
The doctors removed two huge boogers 
that refused to move by any other means. Thankfully he is doing well.
<p />
Kaelans favourite thing at the moment is the number 10. Everything is 10
at the moment.

Today I said to Kaelan he is 1 and tomorrow he will be 2. 
He replied "like binary fission? Or am I a eukaryotes and divide by mitosis?" 
Sometimes he speaks more gobble-dee-gook than the hobbits. 
However, his language skills are improving all the time. Though I wish I knew
what he was talking about at the moment, I'm sure he'd be saying the most interesting things.
<p />
Aden pulled himself from a sitting position to a standing position today.
Not sure when Kaelan stood up, but was it as early as seven months?

Kaelan and Aden have lost their only remaining Great Grand-Parent. Anna O'Connor 
(nee Willison) died last Sunday in a nursing home in Hobawick. 
She was 85 years old and was the wife of George O'Connor who hailed from Dublin. She was the unfortunate 
Grand Mother of the admin assistant.
Luckily she did meet Kaelan and Aden and I have photos of her holding and cuddling them.
The admin assistant said he would tell them about her when they are older. 
Apparently, she used to treat him well, not like me. I believe in exploiting idiots.
Rest in peace Anna. Say hello to Queen Elizabeth I, if you see her. She is my hero.
<p />
Here are some 
<a href="../../imgs/scanned/1992/70thPapas/">photos</a>

a pub called the Mayfied in 1992. Anna is wearing a black top and glasses, 
George is wearing

        Played with the brio trains, he loved the ambulance toy
        putting it in the station. Pressing the lid he would say "open",
        "hello" and "bye, bye".
        He is aware of "open and close" and "hello, goodbye".
        
        Water + Banana @ 10.30am
        Nappy change: wet
        Lovely mild morning, walked through the common. Charlie took
        his scooter. Kaelan fell asleep (big snores).
        
        Lunch 1pm
        Sliced chicken breast sandwich
        Cucumber, cup of milk, banana and 2 yogurts
               
        Nappy change (poo)
        
        Kaelan explored the toys, he like the fruit scales
        putting trains and other toys on it to see the it move.
        He wasn't much interested in the till or paper money but 
        loved cutting the velcro fruit and veg in half. He kept giving
        me the watermelons then cutting it to show me he could do it.
        He also liked the big lego brics he liked looking at the children
        on the box and looking at the colours. Some of the bricks
        had eyes on and he liked collecting them all in to a big file.
        
        Tea 4pm
        Spagetti bolognaise. He was not interested at all!
        I gave him a banana, he at it all, and two yogurts.
        Maybe lunch was too late and tea too early.

This Darwinian evolutionary thing is all fair and well. I agree with it, apart from two counts:
<ol><li>
I am NOT descended from monkeys. However, YOU are.
</li><li>
What possibly could the Hobawick hobbits be descended from?
</li></ol>
<p />
In reality, the first point does not bring Mr Darwins theories into question. 
I am different (and better), that is the end of
that. Simply, his rules do not apply to me, only to everything else. 
When seen in that light his books make a lot of sense.
I simply added this observation for completeness.
<p />
However, the second point makes Darwins theories a bit shakey. What creature on this planet could have
produced the Hobawick hobbits? No amount of imagination can conjure up a predesessor to them!
They could be the missing link between missing links! Perhaps, but realistically I have no idea. I am sure Mr Darwin,
if he was still around, could do some theorising and amend his jottings to include them but I am flumoxed.
Just thinking about them gives me a sore head.

Went to singing with Brit today. "MMM" went a litle green frog apparently. If I had written that song I would at least say the little green frog went "RIBBIT". What kind of frogs does he know anyway? May have to have a chat with him next time I see him. It's ditherers and procastinators that go "MMM". I don't want my boys getting the wrong idea!<br><br>My boys are having very explosive poos at the moment. Both of them are breaking out of their nappys. Quite an irritation when it comes to cleaning up after their episodes.

I enjoy the Epsom life. I made apricot tarts using a recipe one of the Epsom mothers gave me. They were delicous. Just how I like them. Even though the Epsom mothers do have some common traits. They do have their uses.

Kaelan is fascinated by a torch at the moment. He can happily sweep the beam of light around like a light sabre for hours.<br><br>Aden is smiling a lot now. Everytime he sees me he smiles. You can guess what he does when he sees the admin assistant.<br><br>The admin assistant is an idiot. I asked him to do a simple job the other day, and he botched it up. Would someone like to share his job with him? He needs help.

        then he ate it all.

        Played with farm with Jamie; Kaelan was carrying three cows, I was 
        Trying to persuade him to count them. He said a good "moo" and "baby 
        cow". He played with the Bob the Builder toys and cars. He did some 
        drawing on the black board and looked at letters - said clearly "e" 
        and "u". Sat and listened to a book.
</pre>

<p>
Aden, has been a cutey all day. Though he has poo'd a lot. Almost
as much as Kaelan when he was 6 months old.

"A cuckoo lays directly into the host nest". The edwardians discovered
this and I believe there is much to take from it!<br /><br />Had a
walk in Nonsuch today. Vpleasant.

It is very white today. I have never seen such a hard frost on the farm before.
Ruuskii refuses to leave the house.
</p>
<p>
Went to Hemel Hempstead 
<a href="../../imgs/2009/01/10/">today</a>.

Kaelan has been busy. He went to school today. His first day! He also
did some painting. Look! See his first attempt, what a creative 
<a href="../../imgs/2009/01/09/kpainting/">streak</a>.
No doubt you are quite amazed, but hold on, there's 
<a href="../../imgs/2009/01/09/leonardo/">more!</a>.
Kaelan has been watching the News.
He picks things up vquickly. The drama and destruction of war. All captured in
a few deft brush strokes. Also, can you see the references to Picasso's Guernica? 
Not even two years old and he is emulating the Masters.

What a year so far. 
</p>
<p>
The credit crunch continues... May have to make contingency plans. Just incase HSBC goes under.
First to go would be the admin assistant.
</p>

<strong>7th Jan 2009</strong>
<p>
<a href="../../imgs/2009/01/07/">He's</a>
 back. Aden was allowed to leave hosptial this morning. Yipee!!
Contrary to the photo, he is not 100%, but defo better than before he went in.
Booboo is back! Kaelan and Ruuskii were happy to see him, of course.
</p>

Poor booboo. He is still in hospital. He doesn't seem to have gotten any worse though.
Hopefully he will be home by tomorrow. I miss my booboo. Kaelan went into Aden's bedroom this
morning looking for the "baby". Ruuskii misses Aden as well.
</p>
<p>
Cold is the cause of Aden's illness: 
<a href="../../imgs/2009/01/06/pond/">photo</a>.
The ice is thick enough to stand on.
4 out of Aden's six months have had a layer of white on the ground. It's time
things warmed up a bit.

Aden was admitted to hospital today. He has a chesty cough that 
has grown worse over the last few days. So much so, he went off his food
and was struggling to sleep. I took him to the doctors and she advised I
take him to the hospital. I do not think his condition is life threatening
but I am naturaly concerned. The staff at the hospital said it was
very common in children of his age at this time of year. Since they
did such a good job with Kaelan, I will believe them.
</p>
<p>
Will keep you updated.
</p>
<p>
Oh and the admin assistant donated blood today so make sure you don't go and
cut yourself in the next week or two.

Oh and I forgot to mention, Kaelan had his very first haircut yesterday.
A nice man at the barbers (Hair for Man and Boy) in Epsom did a good job. I gave him 
a one shilling tip. Is that what you do at the barbers nowadays?
I'm sure thats what my dad used to give. Not that I know anything about the old
pounds, shillings and pence business. That was way before my time.

Here is a lovely photo of 
<a href="../../imgs/2009/01/03/">Ruuskii</a>.
He looks majestic, running through the frosty countryside of
Surrey. You can see he is happy. Or should I say, I suspect he is happier now, rather than 
living on a building site in Dubai. That's where he was found you know, when he was a puppy.
Roughly 3 years ago. Poor thing. Poor Nero, he should be there, running next to Ruuskii.
</p>
<p>
You wouldn't believe that idiot that admin assistant took the photo, would you? Think it must've been luck.

Still vill. Though I soldier on, doing the chores. 
Where is the maid? Nancy would make a good maid I think.
Perhaps I should propose it to her.
I would pay her in potatoes.  Sid and Nancy love potatoes.
I would also allow them to snuffle round the farm looking for grubs when ever they wanted.
</p>
<p>
I am concerned about Kaelan. He pointed to a magazine and said "Daddy!".
This is the cover of the magazine 
<a href="../../imgs/scanned/leonardodicapriano.jpg">here</a>.
I wish.

This is going to be a quieter year. No more babies. No way.
