Took the boys to "Gravity" this evening. Quite

What a day yesterday was! So many toys the kids got stuck on a Duplo
and Lego set and didn't even manage to open all their presents! 
Strangely, the toys they started playing with were from Sid and Nancy.
I got a onezee. Most comfortable. Also a history book, quite big though.
Some smelleees and socks. That was only the start, oh so many pressies
I must give you all a <big>BIG THANKYOU</big>.
<p />
S&J came round to play today. Good to see them. They of course
brought more pressies, so that was why I let them stay.
We played penguin races and ate an aa pasta.
<p />
Booboo Aden has a little cold. Will need to look after him
a bit more over the next day or two.

Went to see another Santa today. The Surrey Santa isn't quite the same

No snow outside, just a shitty wet cold storm.

I asked the kids what they remembered about the Lapland visit:
Kaelan's favourite was going to see the Northern Lights! We
didn't actually see them, but thats not the point. Aden's favourite
thing was eating an apple. I wish I was joking.
<p />
Christmas is only 3 days away! Hurry now. Make sure those
pressies get to me before Wednesday!!!!!

Back from Lapland! Thank God! Great fun but with two naughty boys:
quite tiring. Photos to follow. Huskys were the best, I was
transported to another world by them. Oh it was like a dream.
Father Christmas came in a close second. Though he was more interested
in the kids than me. He never got a tip.

OOOOO! The final of the XFACTOR tonight! So exciting. Hope that little Scottish hobbit doesn't win. My favourite, Luke Friend went out last night. Shame coz he reminded me of Aden.
<p />
Atlantis! That is my boys fave prog at the mo.
<p />
They are also into the Angry Birds. Only stickers so far. But I am sure they will move on to the game at some point. I am avoiding the moment they ask for a device that can play electronic games. A phone, ipad or some kind of gadget that will only separate them from me. They should only want me for ever!
<p />
As always, a gentle reminder to all my fans that it is CHRISTMAS time soon and Christmas is all about giving PRESENTS to me!

Today Aden opened the 7th of December on the advent calendar. It is a posh advent calendar of course, not one filled with cheap chocolates. There are little toys that collectively will make an advent scene. Anyway Aden informed me that in the box for the 7th was a "slave". I was rather surprised as I cannot recall a slave being in the nativity scene. I queried little Aden and he showed me what he was talking about: a sleigh! I can't remember a sleigh being the nativity either, but at least it has a christmasy theme!
<p />
St Christopher school fayre today!
<p />
Zorro has broken out of the backgarden, again! I have instructed the admin assistant to fix the fence. Hope he does a good job. Zorro is only going to get bigger! Though perhaps not as big as Nero.

<br>Aden wants to go to the place the admin assistant meets the wizard when the wizard wants to give the aa wood for wands. The aa claims the wizard gives him a magic branch at this time of year especially for hime to make wands for Kaelan and Aden. Sure enough, the kids now have 4 wands; 2 from last year and 2 from this year. Pity the wizard can&#096;t make the aa disappear!

Decided to go for a walk today, in central London. Took the kids of course, even took the admin assistant. S of S&J followed us and of course Zorro was there. In hindsight, not sure it was such a good idea to go via the train and underground with Zozzy. It was a bit of a palaver at the escalators. One time, coming down, Zorro was reluctant to get off the damn stairs, in all the panic my dress became trapped in the escalator!! There was a lot of shrieking and adrenalin but a strapping passer-by ripped my dress from me, sorry, from the grips of the escalator. Though not before S had moved like a cobra to flick the panic button and stopped the damn stairs from rolling and sucking me under. Oh what a kerfuffle! I`m ok now. What was the admin assistant doing during all this? Nothing. Well, he said he was controlling Zozzy, but Zozzy can look after himself. Of course.
<br>
<br>Walk was good. Went to Hyde Park and the Serpentine. Lots of people and horses there.

<br>Aden is asking God to stop people needing poos. Aden doesn&#096;t like doing them.

<br>Both my boys were playing with Paper fortune teller games last night. Remarkably it was the admin assistant that showed them how to make/play with them! I didn`t think he was bright enough for that. 
<br>
<br>Here are what he wrote as the fortunes:
<br>
<br>-Clap your hands!
<br>-You look like a banana!
<br>-You have 1 point.
<br>-Make a noise like a duck!
<br>-Give daddy a cuddle!

Heading to the Peak District today.
<br>
<br>However, yesterday we went to Eyemouth, just North of Berwick. Very nice little place, especially liked the seals! In fact, Aden liked the seals so much he attempted to be one! We were by the rock pools below the caravan camp when he decided to jump between some rocks and an outlet. He completed the flight a couple of times but on the third attempt there just wasn&#096;t enough juice in the engines. He stopped half way, hovered for a brief moment then plunged into the icy waters (this is the North Sea remember). He came up screaming and panicking but fortunately the water was only a couple of feet deep. So he stood up and the admin assistant helped him out. His screams were not totally unfounded since the rocks were very sharp and he had scratches all the way down the outside of his left leg. Poor thing. This incident in addition to having dropped his ice-cream into the sand only 30 minutes previously would have brought most young boys to a stop. But not Aden, he quite happily paraded around the centre of Eyemouth in his knickers on the way back to the car.
<br>
<br>We also saw an eel! In the Hobawick stream they call a river, the Teevyit.

Went to Edinburgh zoo yesterday (up in Scotland with the Hobbits, but that&#096;s another story). Kids enjoyed it, though they didn&#096;t see the Haggis that were roaming free amongst the public. The admin assistant, Sid and Nancy were spotting them all over the place!? Penguin walk was good fun. Not as many were let out from their enclosure as I remember from my childhood but still exiting for the kids. If Sid had stumbled along side I don&#096;t thing most people could have told the difference. Short, squat with a funny walk! He would have fitted in perfectly. Lions were sleeping when we saw them. Tiger was pacing. Warthog babies were cute.
<br>
<br>My children have developed a habit of comparing the size of my ass with everything. Yesterday, at the zoo, they even said it was bigger than Nancy&#096;s. Now that is just ridiculous.

<br>Went to Holy Island on Monday, saw some Viking&#096;s get their ass whipped by the English.

She did indeed make lots of jam for us, especially toot and djeghan (thats loganberry and apricot)
We also knew a white haired Karine who was a nanny for the boys when they were babies,

Did I tell you one day in Armenia (when we lived there, as opposed to gallavanting there on holiday) we were sitting on Aden`s bed looking at a book of animals. I was pointing to a picture of an elephant and I asked Aden what it was. He started saying peegh! peegh! I thought "What is this boy on? Surely he knows an elephant when he sees one!" However, he insisted it was a peegh! I was growing increasingly frustrated with the situation when I heard a giggling behind me, it was the admin assistant. I asked him what he was laughing at, and he advised me that Aden was saying "elephant" not in English but in Armenian!

A first! My boys woke up this morning, played for a bit with their Duplo characters. After they got bored, they proceeded to dress themselves and go out to play in the garden! I have never seen them decide to get dressed on their own before. After which they did indeed go out to play in the garden, or should I say terrorise the fish in the pond. They have taken to catching them in a net, inspecting them, then putting them back into the pond. However, the poor fish cannot hold their breath for the amount of time they are required to, and often die. I tell the children off of course.

Can you believe she turned up at the school!! Who? Her! Nana Nancy!! I knew there was a nefarious odour around Epsom. She broke into their school and invaded their classrooms. All hell broke loose, as can be expected. Aden got a football in the face and afterwards she watched year 2 singing but not before making Aden laugh. The year 2`s were singings in African and Latin!! Not that Nancy knew what they were singing. She was quite lost in the school. But, and can you believe it! Aden&#096;s teacher knew some Hobitish!

D-Day: that is Kaelan&#096;s big war thing at the moment. Drawing boats landing on beaches; avoiding mortar bombs and making sure the flags are on the correct side of the drawing (Germans to the right, Allies to the left). And of course, to make the picture complete, he needs his great grand-dad riding on his bicycle on the french beaches chasing the gerries. Of course this scenario is not quite true. The Allies did invade France on D-Day, and Kaelan and Aden&#096;s Great-Grandad was there, but his Great Grandad-dad did not ride his bicycle over the beaches chasing the gerries, the lazy Irish toad dropped it in the sea and strolled on to the beach like it was a Sunday afternoon, then lay down his towel to enhance his tan! Thankfully his seniors told him off.
<br>
<br>Oh, and BTW, their Scottish Great-Grandad went to Holland for an ice-cream during the war!! Talk of liberation? I call it using the tax payers money to have a jolly at their expense!

Ugh, the hobbits are brewing their favourite sausage to celebrate that bard they call a poet tonight. Disgusting. Have you ever tasted it? Hoggis I think it is called. Made from dead hog no doubt. Then they will drink it&#096;s pee till they wrench. The thought makes me queasy.

<br>I would like to say that myself, Kaelan and Aden hope to see you soon, but I don`t think that will happen. How much longer can you last?

Ruuskii has been escaping from the garden in the Epsom house. If he stayed in the neighbours garden, that would be fine but he goes farther afield and strays onto the road! It is not a quiet road and I fear he could cause an accident or be killed himself. I instructed the gardening team to put fences around the garden so he cannot roam again. Ruuskii will be sad because not matter what house he has lived in, the first thing he does is to try and get out and make friends. Sorry Ruuskii, it is for your own good.

Aden was cycling again in Nonsuch Park yesterday. Doing very well I must say. Stopping is not so easy for him though. One time he ended up in a bush. Quite often there was little heap of Aden and bicycle in the middle of the path. But he was very brave and only once did I think he wasn&#096;t going to get on a bicycle again. But he got over it.

Kaelan is, of course; a wizard. 
He magicked a bowl of hot water to a colder temperature simply by issuing a simple spell. I think he impressed himself! He defo impressed me.
<p />
Aden is also impressing me, he was riding a bike today in Nonsuch park. More or less, he could go 20-30 metres unaided! He
could probably go further but the paths were packed. 
Lovely sunny day, you see.
