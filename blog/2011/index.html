The hobbits have things similar to fireworks but are called "squeebs". The word says it all really. Their
version of fireworks are not worth writing about apart from their limp nature. Oh, what a sad show.
Luckily London didn't let us down! Did you see their show? Much more grand than the Edinburgh one.
<p />
So, my dear fans, as I bid farewell to 2011... THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME YOUR NUMBER ONE THIS YEAR!!!
JUST MAKE SURE YOU DO BETTER NEXT YEAR!!!

Had an evening without drinking alcohol last night. The hobbits were very upset, they drank themselves stupid, once again. Even when Sidney went to hospital, to have his bladder emptied, they still kept on drinking. Can you believe it! Sidney&#096;s bladder isn&#096;t big enough for his debauchery! 
<br>
<br>Like an angel, I rise above all this debauchery.

Oh, I am bloated.
<br>
<br>Boys have been generally good today, though Aden is starting to play up now. However, it is 9:21pm so perhaps it best to ship him off to bed.
<br>
<br>Oh and I am in Scotland because I felt sorry for the hobbits, I accepted their (contintual) pleading for me to come up here. The living conditions are generally squalid, as can be imagined.
<br>
<br>As usual there have been a line of hobbits waiting to meet me. We went to Prof Ann&#096;s burrow first of all this morning. Surprisingly, no alcohol was consumed there, then Frando, Wee&#096;dith and Booby visited Sidneys house. Kaelan and Aden do seem to take to these creatures, Kaelan has even been mimicing their language (or what passes for a language in these parts). "Yin, twa, thri, fower....", I think they are reciting some kind of spell or somesuch nonsense, no problem to Kaelan he has it down a tea!
<br>
<br>Since I am of a good sort, I still lavished presents on these animals even though I received nothing in return. But as you know, that is of no matter to me, since I am of a true generous kindly sort.
<br>
<br>On to Boxing day, lets see what these oiks can conjur up to challenge my good will and charity.

Hmmph. There is no pleasing some people.
<br>
<br>Over the last week or so I have been spoiling my boys by taking them to lovely places and buying them lovely things. Yesterday I took them to the local shopping arcade here in Epsom to look at toys and buy them MORE fun things. Also, afterwards I had organised to take them to Epsom Playhouse to watch Cinderella. During lunch however, Kaelan was being a bit naughty and not eating his food. I explained to him that over the last week I had taken him to this lovely place, or that lovely place; that I had bought him this lovely thing, or that lovely thing; that he was a really lucky boy and what else could he possibly want? He answered: "I don`t know what else I want. Let me think". What is one to do?? 
<br>
<br>Additionaly, some onlookers laughed when they heard Kaelan say this, so he turned round and said "Move on, there is nothing to laugh at here!". Oh that spoilt little brat. Where has my little booboo gone!!

My boys are being very cute at the moment. For their own amusement, they are singing Jingle Bells when the desire takes them. They both know the words off by heart. Sometimes, once or twice a minute, their pitches coincide with each others and I can almost imagine them being the Flying Pickets or House Martins or some other such fine harmonious vocal band. However, that only lasts for a second or two and then my boys are off again, quite like little kittens or puppies, howling to the moon.

Ugh, I&#096;ve just worked out what that smell is. Its Nancy preparing lagered kippers for Sidney&#096;s 365th birthday. Oh they are such foul creatures. I can smell their putrid odour in Armenia, imagine what the smell must be like in France or Beligium!! Poor Europe, I can see why it is falling apart.

Aden is naughty. Now Miss Hasmik knows. She is Aden and Kaelan&#096;s teacher. Here is her description of what Aden did yesterday:
<br>
<br>Yesterday when I went to get the kids from the lunch room the teachers on duty told me that Aden had run away from the lunch room and they couldn&#096;t find him. We have been looking for him for more then 5 minutes and you can imagine how worried we were. We checked everywhere including all the bathrooms as well. But obviously he and one of his classmates were hiding in the adults&#096; bathroom and not answering the calls of the teachers so we couldn&#096;t find them. He had to miss his afternoon recess and stay in the classroom. This was the story about Aden&#096;s naughty behaviour yesterday.
<br>
<br>I expect to get more reports like this over the time he is at school.

Juice! Juice! What is he on 
<a href="../../imgs/2011/11/24/">about</a>?
"Mummy!" That is what you are meant to say Kaelan! Oh, I do try my best.
At least Aden said something sensible. First time.
<p />
Oh, I should explain, this list is from the school where Kaelan and Aden
attend. It is an american based school and they had a small activity
for Thanksgiving, as you can see, every child was asked what they are
thankful for. Kaelan said "Juice". I cannot believe it.
<p />
I am very proud of Aden. He said a lovely thing: "My brother". Though,
in reality
he should have said "My Mummy first of all, then my brother, then Edo and
Ruuskii, then noor." (oh noor is pomegranite. They cannot get enough
of them at the moment)

I was on Armenian TV this evening, again! But, you know, I do feel that they should concentrate on me MORE!! Two seconds of a profile view is not enough. I delivered a profound (and I mean profound) speech, to the masses so why was my diatribe not aired? Even Sarkozy received more airtime when he was in Armenia a few weeks ago! Anyway, now my boys can go in to school and brag to their friends that their mummy is famous. Should I say, way more famous than any of their wanna-be-star parents.

"Do you remember Pinky?" I asked Aden the other day. 
<p />
She was the Austrian nanny that worked for us a couple of years ago. 
She was actually called Vicky, but Kaelan prounced her name as "Pinky", so that became her name.
Aden said "Yes" he did remember her, which is slightly remarkable since he was only 17 months old when she left.
So I quizzed him further... what colour was her hair?
She had a very distinctive Northern European blond head of hair which I thought if anything he might remember.
Anyway, his answer said it all: "Pink!".

Usually, before I go to work each morning I make the kids some semolina with a jam dolop mixed-in for their breakfast. I make it about 15 minutes before they wake up, to give it time to cool before they tuck in. This morning however, just as I had finished putting their bowls and cups of juice on the table, Kaelan turned up. He had obviously woken up of his own accord. This usually happens if he pees the the bed, so I feared the worse. But he reasured me, "I`ve not done a peepee. Is breakfast ready?". I warned him that the porridge (thats what I call it) was hot. He retorted: "Why do you think you know everything?!!". I was about to explain that usually he is asleep as I`m making the breakfast... and then there was a squeal and a little red tongue frantically trying to grasp the cool air all around. Serves the little sod right.

Aden is so lovely. Quite independently, and completely unprompted he will come up to me, when I`ve arrived home after a hard days work, 
just to say he likes the dress I am wearing! Oh, I am so lucky. Kaelan also says this to me, but slightly less often. 
Usually when I arrive home, he is too involved watching cartoons on the PC, but after a little prodding he also starts to flatter me, quite unashamedly saying how lovely I am.

Kaelan asked today (while he was having a poo), "How does the sperm get in side your belly?". 
By "your belly", he meant mine. Now, I am unsure of what they are teaching in schools now-a-days, 
but I sure as hell hope the next time they start a lesson, they finish it off! I was speechless. 
I had to vacate the bathroom. This type of conversations is for 18+ year olds.

Kaelan and Aden`s first day at their new school yesterday. This is the "Big Boy School". Aden sticks his chest out when we say he is going to the "Big Boy School". Me big boy!
<br>
<br>However, I was hoping Kaelan would come home brimming with stories of his first day and lots of new information that he had been taught, but instead he said "I had a fight. With two bad guys. And I beat them!" Now, this makes me ponder on numerous levels. Is my little angel really a thug? Why are students fighting at the new school? What are the teachers doing? Why was booboo brimming with excitement and a new found confidence while reciting the story?! Is this what I can expect from my sons? Brawling!
<br>
<br>I am taking Kaelan to Oman for the weekend, I will try and re-educate him on the softer things in life while he is with me. I will also consider finding another school in Yerevan.

Two evenings ago the mountain opposite my house (which also happens to be the biggest mountain in Armenia) had a dark thunderstorm brooding over it and I wondered what it must be like at the top, 14,000 feet up in that maelstrom. The next morning, when I looked out the window, the was a fresh covering of snow on the upper reaches. I know people go camping up there at this time of year, it is only August after all.

He is very proud of himself, he knows he is a special little boy today
and pulls a smug face when we mention his birthday to people.
Make no mistake when people ask how old he is 3 fingers shoot up
into the air.
Booth my booboos are playing with a new toy Aden received, a(nother)

<br>I forgot to mention, Kaelan has Chickenpox, again!! He is special. The last time he had them in Epsom, he only had a few spots. That was after Aden had them. Perhaps it wasn&#096;t a proper dose.
<br>
<br>I also forgot to mention those dumb hobbits called on Skype yesterday and wished Aden a happy birthday. Ugh. How stupid can a hobbit be?

Ah, 35 today. Plenty years in me yet. By my reckoning I'm only
a third of the way through my glorious life.
Thanks for all the cards, I think this is the first year where
electronic cards out-numbered physical ones, but it was very close.
Electronic cards = 4,499,322 and physical cards = 4,499,321.

Taking Kaelan to see his new September school in England today. Though I have told him he has a new September school in Armenia, as well. I wonder if he gets confused? He seems to take it all in his stride. Not everyone can be so accomodating though.

This is getting too much. I took Kaelan for a pee before I went to bed last night and while he was half asleep he starting talking to me in Armenian!!!

<br>When I take Aden for a pee, he grinds his teeth.

Kaelan has some street girls now. They are local Armenian girls who play on the street outside our house. I think they have taken a fancy to my boys, and my boys quite like them. Kaelan&#096;s Armenian is very good now. At least he understands the girls and they understand him.
<br>
<br>Oh, and Kaelan genuinely calls them: "his girls". "Where are my girls?" he asks when we return from a fantastic long day out. As though he has missed them. "I want to play with them"

I have been unable to blog since I have been in hiding for the past week
and a half.
Somehow the hobbits breached my defenses. The US Navy Seals 
were in part responsible.
After their expedition in Pakistan, the hobbits
requested their services to break into by house.
<p />
As you can expect I have been deeply traumatised by this:

Kaelan is convinced that monsters frequent the house at night, hence the reason he jumps into my bed at 3am saying he needs a cuddle.
<br>
<br>Aden is Aden. He says he is one year old when he wants to be carried, he says he is five when it is preferable to be a big boy and do big boy things.

<br>As you know, I am glorious, thoroughly.

Oh dear, what is that smell?
<br>
<br>Its like rotten oily fishy, garlicy, beery vomit that has been sitting in the sun too long.
<br>
<br>Oh it fills my nostrils and I want to be sick. What can it be?
<br>
<br>It reminds me of a smell that comes from a meal the Hobbits concoct when they celebrate something. Fried kippers and garlic, washed down with lager. Then with great hilarity, they burp extensively after they`ve finished and the room they have been eating in becomes a veritable health hazard.
<br>
<br>Oh I`ve just had a thought, it is Nana Nancy`s birthday today. The smell must have come from her and Sid`s after breakfast belching.
<br>
<br>Oh, where is the maid. I have made a terrible mess on the carpet, MY breakfast wouldn`t stay down once I had that horrifying vision in my head.
<br>
<br>I wouldn`t have believed it, a smell cannot travel that far, surely. From Hobawick to Armenia? Oh they are wretched creatures. Planet earth has been contaminated thoroughly, and will never be same.
<br>
<br>==============================================
<br>
<br>HAPPY BIRTHDAY NANCY!!
<br>Love Kaelan and Aden.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY KAELAN!!
<br>
<br>He is four today, can you believe it? He is now officially a boy. Not that he was a girl beforehand, just I mean, when does toddler become a boy? Is it three? Not sure, but definitely by 4 you are no longer a baby. So he is now a boy!
<br>
<br>Unfortunately I am off to France for some training. Us international people need international training.
<br>
<br>Took Kaelan and Aden to a play centre today in Yerevan. Kaelan poo-ed his pants. I am not joking. 4 years old and he is still shitting his knickers.
We went to Garlics house:

Oh I forgot to tell you. We had a "lost child" incident in the Atlantis hotel when we were staying in Dubai. We were staying in the luxury penthouse suites on the 14th floor when Aden decided to go for a walk about. He opened the door to the suite and went down the lifts and was found on the 3rd floor, crying. Needless to say I was worried sick and some members of my staff were fired.
<br>
<br>The net usage of nappies in this household over the last 24 hours was 0. The first time ever! Note: both boys had nappies on last night but neither of them used them so the same nappies will be used tonight. 
<br>
<br>IMPORTANTLY, it is Kaelans 4th birthday on Sunday. DO NOT FORGET!!!!

Here are some notes the child minder took of when Kalean stayed with her in London recently:
<p />
<pre>           <b>Kaelan - 31.01.11 - 02.02.11</b>

<b>Activities</b>

Played duplo - took a palm tree to Matthews speech therapy
assessment - also enjoyed playing with the duplo at the speech
clinic (and looking at a book about a dinosaur)

Coloured lots of pictures
Played with Castle - like the flying dragon

Played football table

Went to Phoenix Centre with (his friend) William - particularly
enjoyed at the end when he helped to tidy away the equipment!!
and William gave Kaelan a packet of chocolate buttons!

Loved playing in the bath with Sophie - fishing game/diego boat
and Pooh house (with bubbles)

Went to the library with Sophie and chose two books to bring home - 
one was about a dragon which he was read at bedtime.

Helped Grandma with the digging in the garden - Kaelan pushed
the wheel barrow - very concerned about welfare of the 
earthworms!!

Watched Toy Story 2 DVD

Played with Woody and Buzz Lightyear (couldn't understand why
Matthews 7 year old Buff doesn't have retractable wings)

Unfortunately last night there were complaints from Sophie about
her being woken in the night because of Kaelans snoring!!

My booboo is not feeling to good today. I think he must have a virus. He is wheezing and coughing a lot.
<br>
<br>Though he can&#096;t be feeling that bad, because when I asked if my booboo was feeling ill he said "no booboo, BIG BOY!".

My, there has been a fresh fall of snow in Yerevan, but that doesn&#096;t bother me because I am in England, with Kaelan. Ah what a jet set life we have.
<br>
<br>Unfortunately Aden doesn&#096;t travel too well. It takes him quite a few days to get over the time difference and by the time he has adjusted it is time to go back! Not every one can be as adaptable as me!
<br>
<br>The admin assistant just doesn&#096;t know what&#096;s going on.

<br>
<br>The school has instructed:
<br>
<br>It&#096;s wintertime and the children love to play in the snow. The children play outside for about 40 minutes.
<br>Please make sure they have snowpants/ water proof pants, gloves/mittens, hat and scarf every day at school.
<br>
<br>Thanks,
<br>Lily/Aida/Astghik
<br>
<br>Snowpants? What do they do I wonder? Put the snow into your crotchal area? No thanks. I think they mean snow proof pants. But non-native English speakers do have problems. Full stop.

Back in Yerevan today. Quite chilly, hovering around the 0 degree mark.

<br>Kaelan is a little fibber. He says Aden hits him but I know full Aden hasn&#096;t.
