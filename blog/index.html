Aden was a bit mischevious today. 
He set up traps for me and Kaelan to be surprised with.
<p />
One was very lovely, a drawing of some flowers, he left it in the cutlery drawer.
However, dropping teddys from above his bedroom door was a bit more naughty.

On this last day of 2014 I would just like to congratulate me on 
my radiant wonderfulness and beauty. My resilienceness in the face
of adversity keeps the world going. My remarkableness in the 
face of boring normality brings light and excitement to all your sorry
lives. My generosity gives and keeps on giving. I know no bounds of
wonderfulness. The earth does not limit me. I float on a celestial wave
of energy through this galaxy. I do not perspire, I INSPIRE!
<p />
Thank me.

<p />
MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONE!!
<p />
The kids are 1% through opening their presents and they are knackered.
No kidding, I thought I had worked hard in the preperation up to Christmas
but the boys are really working now. Their little hands are aquiring blisters.
<p />
But it is worth it!
<p />
The front room is like a toy shop.
<p />
Santa must've enjoyed his beer and biscuits and Rudolf and co. must
appreciated the carrots, everything was gone this morning.
Kids still believe (I think), I know I do!
<p />
aa made chicken for Christmas lunch. Very tastey. Though I think we will be eating 
it for days.
<p />
Finally, if you come to stay at my hamlet, do not keep me waiting.
J decided to have a bath first thing this morning before opening presents
but after kids had woken up! NOT A GOOD IDEA. Have you tried to entertain
children who are exploding before?

Chrimbo is upon us! Presents are arriving by the bucket load. 
No sign of snow yet. But I won't give up hoping! Every
2 mins I am peeking out the window to see if I can see a little white flutter...somewhere.
So busy preparing, hope everyone appreciates me.
I am the Christmas bee. Busy busy busy.
Oh are all my efforts in vain. I am so good. Everyone must see it. Surely?
<p />
The boys have also been busy. The aa took them to Southampton yesterday, they bought me some
presents apparently. Keeping secrets is not their strong point, in fact with all the slip-ups 
they are making I can almost guess what I will receive. Never mind I am still
peeing myself with excitement.
<p />
The new hamlet is also nearly finished. This is where the guests and pigs will stay.

The boys are helping the Croat wrap presents.

The aa is making excuses about persents not arriving because of the suppliers/manufacturers.

Aden asked an interesting question today: What would happen if you put a poo in the oven?
<p />
I think it is important to describe his context: he had just finished doing a poo and infact
he had just had his bum cleaned and was in
the process of washing his hands.
He further remarked "you would see all the germs".
<p />
He is, I think you'll agree, destined for scientific greatness. Science does not
follow social niceties and he is happy to challenge and ask
questions that should not normally be asked.

Zorro is biting all the workmen that are doing up the house.
He is getting me into trouble.
But he is Zorro, son of Nero, so he is allowed to bite.
Got a problem with that? Speak to Zorro about it. He will enjoy your screams as
he gnaws off your head. HAHAHAHAHA!

Is Christmas really only 12 days 12 hours away?

You still have time. 
Presents are waiting to be bought and delivered.
And I am happy to receive any and all gifts.
Thankyou in advance.
<p />
I am in need.
<p />
Leaky roof in NF. Now that is something I don't need.
I wonder if Santa would bring me a new roof.
Bit awkward to carry, but I'm sure he could manage.

Took the boys (kids and dogs) to the NF at the weekend. Not that that was 
different from usual, but the interaction with the animals was spectacular.
Zorro decided to bite a horses nose and another horse decided to kick Kaelan!
Don't worry the horse was ok, Zorro didn't get a good hold.
Oh and Kaelan? Yeh, he was ok as well.
Cried a bit because of the shock but only a tiny
bruise came up.
<p />
That is what happens when you live on the wild side!

Biggest opera of the year today. Pre-school Nativity at Walhampton! 
Aden is Joseph.
<p />
Aden was Joseph with a plumb. Sorry aplomb.
He remembered his lines to perfection,
He danced like an angel (there were quite a few of them!).
He sung with gusto.
He was a great father to the baby Jesus and husband to Mary. 
He collected the presents from the three wise men as though they were his own.
Convincing, convincing, convincing.
The whole cast were amazing actually. 
The little sheep were plentiful as were
the peasants (every good opera need plenty of peasants).
<p />
Then of course, there were the mince pies afterwards. Quite deelish.

Match Attax. Match Attax. Match Attax. Everything is Match Attax at the moment.
Well, it is for Kaelan anyway. Aden isn't interested in Match Attax, but he cannot
lose out if Kaelan gets a packet of Match Attax cards. He needs 
compensated to a similar amount. Ideally more.

Thought it would make sense, so I registered the kids and me with a Doctors surgery in the NF. 
As soon as I walked in the door they said I didn't need bother!
I was radiating so much health and beauty, they just said go home and bring back 10 of whatever I was having.
<p />
However, without hesitation (but with some alarm) as soon as they saw the aa, they immediately administered 2 injections.
Enough said.

Did I mention the admin assistant did something useful on Saturday as well?
He cut the boys hair. They were ragamuffin nit infested tramps. 
So the aa cropped the boy's hair. No joke. 
The hairdressers I had taken them to refused to cut their hair because of the nits (snobs).
<p />
And thankfully no blood. 
Then he applied nit solution to their heads. 
Looks to have largely worked.
<p />
Also, have found a Croation walking the streets. So have 
invited her in to the house. She can look after the kids and dogs and everything else domestic, if she wants.
What do you mean? I'm doing her a bloody favour!
<p />
The aa didn't too bad a job. That'll save me having to pay a barber from now on.

The admin assistant did something useful today.
He made a tree swing for the boys.
Still, I didn't ask him to do that. 
So no brownie points for him.
Brownies points are awarded to those who know what I want without asking me.
If I have to tell them, or if they have to ask me, then they have failed
and will be punished accordingly. 
Failures can be punished for a LONG time.
Weeks. Indeed months. In fact I have been known to punish for years.
<p />
Do not fail me. My adorable fans.

Went to Chessington today, lots of fun. Until.... Aden disappeared.
<p />
It's true. I lost Aden. What kind of mother am I?
<p />
Fortunately Adens memory came to the rescue. He remembered my telephone number. 
The quick thinking little lad went into a shop in Chessington and told the lady he was lost
then gave her my number.
He was saved. She called me and we were reunited. When we saw each other again there was
much emotion. As you can understand.
<p />
But importantly, who taught Aden my telephone number? Was it me? Can't remember.
<p />
Anyway, going to see Sophie and Jamie tonight in Banstead. Fun Fun Fun.

I received Kaelan's grades today, for his autumn term.
He has done adequately. BUT there is always room for improvement.
Complacency is not in my vocab.
<p />
His higest scores were for History and Religious Studies.
His aptitude for history comes from me, as does his sense of specialness (that is what RS is about).
It just so happens he got the same high score for Art, but that is of no
consequence.
Everything else was pretty much around the same score, his lowest by a whisker
was Physical Education.
That was always on the cards, I am afraid. He runs like a one legged wombat.
<p />
I look forward to Adens report.

Talking about chess. Kaelan goes to the school chess club. He beats everyone, of course.
However, he started getting upset when the other pupils started cheating when playing
against him. I said, "walk all over them, whether they are cheating or not!".
Take no prisoners. Thats my motto.

I graced Aunt Polly with the kid's presence via Skype on the tablet for her (day after) birthday.

Chilly.
<p />
How do the moles in the garden stay warm? I have moles and believe me
I am not getting rid of them like many heathens would do. They 
are my little underground pets. Wimbledon has the wombles, I have my
moles.
<p />
Aden has taken to making buildings out of the moving boxes that are
cluttering the house. He made one over his bed and almost fell asleep
in it last night. The boxes are quite versatile. They can move 
from being a house to spaceship to boat quite easily.
<p />
Kaelan went to school yesterday morning. He plays chess and football.

The boys are growing increasingly interested in football.
This worries me.

Thankfully Kaelan still adores his little teddy.
He assures me he will always carry him around.
<p />
The boys are growing increasingly interested in Angry Birds Star Wars.
This REALLY worries me.

Aden still likes to be carried upstairs at bed time though.
He will never get too old to not be carried upstairs.
In fact they both will never get too old to be carried upstairs.

My new phone was handed to me today. An iPhone 6.
It was handed to me, though I am unsure how to work it.
I thought it would be really hip to have an iPhone 6 until 
an 85 year old showed up in the shop with one, then
started to use it. She was really adept. I was quite 
embarrassed at my technological limitations.
I will persevere, if kids and grannys can do it,
I'm sure the generations in between can manage...

Other news! The boys saw two Lancaster bombers flying over the house on Saturday!
My, the planes were like dragons, the way they roared. Then to top it all
off we all saw them flying along the coast on Sunday! I have some photos.
Must share.
<p />
The boys are enjoying their school. Really doing well. They both have been 
Stars of the Week of their respective classes.
<p />
Kaelan went to chess club this evening. He won two games, both against

For Kaelan, ecstasy is Star Wars LEGO!
He is mental for it.
His Christmas list is full of requests for Starts Wars LEGO.
He helped me scan it yesterday. I will post it soon.
It makes for interesting reading.
Aden likes pretending he has a double light sabre. 
He weilds it like a true Darth Vader.

I have not written any verse for a long time.

<p />
.............................................
<p />
<b><i>The Reality of Perfection.</i></b>
<p />
My expectations are high.<br>
I never make mistakes,<br>
Therefore I never say sorry.<br>
Never have done,<br>
Never will do.
<p />
If you are performant<br>
And provide for my needs<br>
And exceed my targets<br>
By 125%<br>
You may receive my tenderness.<br>
<p />
For those of you,<br>
Who do not come up to my level:<br>
Perish.
<p />
Above or below,<br>
Being with me is reward enough.<br>
What else could you want?<br>
I am perfect.<br>
In the perfect sense of the word.
<p />
What is required of me?<br>
You dullard!<br>
Nothing.
<p />
Me in me and of me is enough for you.
<p />
To change is for loosers.<br>
If you were not born perfect,<br>
Then whats the point?<br>
If you have to stop and think,<br>
If you have to assess and learn,<br>
If you have to <i>try</i> to be a Godess....<br>
<p />
Bless you.
<p />
But you will never make it.
<p />
To my level.
<p />
Of course you can be my fan.<br>
That is quite ok.<br>
As long as you know,<br>
You have to pay for a signed photo.
<p />
I am free.<br>
So are you.<br>
But I only employ slaves.
<p />
I am one.<br>
You are two.<br>
Just accept it.
<p />
Give, give, give.<br>
Thats me.<br>
<p />
Compassion.<br>
<p />
Thats my strong point.<br>
<p />
Beauty.<br>
You can't buy it<br>
But I have it.<br>
I know.
<p />
Defended can be more than defence.<br>
Make it aggresive defence.<br>
Thats what Zorro does.<br>
Bite before you are bitten.<br>
Never let the weak in.
<p />
Is it me?<br>
Is it you?<br>

Aden is 6 today!! It is definitely a Power Rangers birthday.
Toys on the theme abound and he has a new pair of pyjamas
of the same. The admin assistant pretended to be a naijloch
but was quickly run through with a sword (or is it zord?).
I baked a cake. My children expect this from me when it is
their birthday. Of course I relish the opportunity of baking.

Aden had to leave, it was too scarey for him. Kaelan

I have no idea how these things happen but Nancy breached the house defences last Sunday
and has made herself quite at home for the last 7 days.
First the wine went missing. But that is expected, though unwanted.
Then the boys started calling her Granny. I have no idea why they do this.
Then she started going the events that were quite obviously ear-marked for the
more better of us: the St Christopher (posh) school fair, the school show,
Sunday swimming, Little dragons etc... etc...
Do you know what it feels like to have a hobbit follow you around all day?
<p />
And to top it all off Zorro's balls have gone missing!!
I quite literally mean his testicles.
Where has she put them?
He is quite perplexed, as you can imagine.
<p />
One consolation, Sidney Hobbit hasn't made an appearence.
Though I do not want to speak too soon.

Thankyou Thankyou Thankyou.

You are so kind.
<p />
Yes, I adore you. Only a little bit mind. I know you all
adore me with as much vigour as you always have. That

To celebrate, Zorro bit an estate agent that came round to the house.
<p />
The kids drew me lovely cards of summer things. They are wonderful.
<p />
I am on such a high. Nothing could bring be down.

Finally the aa has bought himself a car. Well, when I say a

I would go for. But a vehicle with an internal combustion
engine, never-the-less.
<p />
It is one week to the biggest day of the year. I'll say
no more apart from: concert your efforts. Or there
will be consequences.
The World Cup may be on. But there bigger things

Kaelan and Aden have started writing their Christmas lists.
Kaelan's is the most extensive, running to almost 3 A4 sheets.
Aden's is more modest at about 1.5 sheets of A4. Though I am
unsure if that is a reflection of Aden's more restrained needs
or the fact he is a slower writer. Probably the later.
<p />
Went to the Nonsuch Teddy Bear pic-nic today.
Boys loved it. Though I suspect Kalean may be feeling like 
he did yesterday when we went to the playground in Haywards Heath.
He said the games were too young for him. At 7.25 years old he thinks
he is above going to the playground. Oh how things have changed.
<p />
Also, here is a notice to any who enter my house and want
to use the conveniences:

Yesterday, Kaelan asked how many teeth humans have.
I said 32 (quietly confident in my answer, though I hadn't counted for ages)
He then asked if I knew how many teeth Elephants have. I said I didn't.
Undissapointed with my response, he went on... "What is 6 x 32?" 
I answered 192. He seemed impressed.
He then informed me that elephants go through 6 sets of teeth in their lifetime 
and if they had 32 teeth in each set they would receive 192 pounds in total, if they got one pound for every
tooth they lost.
Thats my boy! Looking to make money at every opportunity.

The Galapagos Islands lived up to their reputation. Vimpressive.  Must

like me. Fiery and a bit sharp at the edges, like me.  Loads of photos
and stories to follow. Though the highlight of the holiday was for the
animals of course. They didn't try to run away from me or anything.
They felt totally calm in my presence. In fact I thought some of them
were over-whelmed. The turtles were lovely, so were the rays, they

Bottles for milk. You know, like the ones for babies.

I think its important to make them feel as though are still booboos.
<p />
They enjoyed watching a video of Kaelan drinking milk from a bottle
when he was't even a year old, so why can't they emulate that when
they are 5 and 6 years old? Kaelan is nearly 7.  SO WHAT!

The boys got caught in a storm today on the Epsom Downs.
Almost blew them away! They were out looking for branches

for!
So does coca-cola! It makes them feel a bit drunk when
they have too much of it. They went to the Derby Arms, at
the edge of the Epsom downs, and drank a whole bottle each.
They both enjoyed it. Though I think they enjoyed the
pictures of naked ladies bottoms in the Gents toilets more!
