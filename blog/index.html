Boys are back to school today! May send Zorro with them, see if
he can be taught to bite only baddies. That would be ideal!
Otherwise I cannot predicte the future for him.

The aa is such an idiot.
He has started making his own beer.
He bottled the first ever batch today and seemed very proud of himself.
He will be upset when I give it all to the pigs.
Though Kaelan and Aden took an unhealthy interest in helping him.

Phew, my head is a little bit sore today!
Had a party in the NF chateaux. HK, SOF, May-Anne, Ricky and Lara were hear celebrating the new year.
We were swilling drink like it was going out of fashion!
Fireworks in the garden were a little bit less involved than those up at the London Eye but still entertaining!
Unfortunately Zorro got a excited with all the noise and bright lights and bit Lara (she is only 9 years old).
<p />
BTW I think Kaelan has a soft spot for Lara! They were playing at math calculations and code names on knapkins
in the May Flower, when we all went for a pub lunch. Vsweet.
