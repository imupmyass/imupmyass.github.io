Hi and welcome to the most interesting blog around.
Lots of new and fascinating updates about my life nearly every day.

Happy birthday Zozzeee! 3 today. I can't believe
he has made it. There have been quite a few points when
I though he might get put down. If cats have 9 lives then
I wonder how many bites dogs have? I think Zozzeee might
be running out!
<p />
Tezza has died :(  This a shame. He was the only
Irish person I liked. The Irish/Welsh/Scottish, I'd
be quite happy for them to be taken to a rocket and
blasted into space, but Tezza was different.
Apparently he helped raise nearly £900m for charity.
What a star!
We are stars!
<p />
Aden has been a good boy for a few weeks now.
What has happened?

<p />
Went for a walk today, by the seaside, by Christchurch.
We had just got to the beach when Aden nearly got washed away by a wave.
Seriously, he could have been swept away, but fortunately he didn't but did he get a good
soaking instead. He does have a habit of doing this, getting wet while out walking.
I may suggest he wears a wetsuit. I'm sure he would have a little moan
but it would cover damp eventualities.
<p />
While on the beach walk I decided to do some clearing up of rubbish.
I picked up a big blue plastic bag and used it to stuff
the flotsam into.
What's better I made the aa carry it.
I have the ideas and I get other people to do the doing.
And they have the audacity to complain?

Had a drive up to London on Saturday to see some Armenian fans, well
they don't come from Armenia but that is where they discovered me.
They have never been the same, their lifes are complete, especially
now that they have moved to England to be closer to me.
<p />
Kaelan and Aden were laughing about the Pirate Ned Smul and his
cohort Pirate A yesterday. Pirate A's real name is Pirate Ned A.
but you can't have two pirates called Ned! Pirate A has 4 eye patches:
one on each eye and ear. He see's through his bum, apart from when
he has diarrhea.

Yes, I live with two fat pigs! What of it?

Its so funny. Should I say: I am so funny.
<p />
Though I am very sad at the loss of one of my favourite fans: David Bowie.
<p />
He was a very innovative fan, he would excel himself in the ways
he would show his enthusiasm. Very creative with his prose of admiration.
<p />
Hey Ass,<br>
You surpass,<br>
Even me.<br>
Hard to see,<br>
How it can be done.<br>
Must be that amazing bum.
<p />
I was quite touched when he sent that to me. Though I was a bit
disappointed he didn't release a single with my visage on the cover....
Or derriere for that matter.

Boys are back to school today! May send Zorro with them, see if
he can be taught to bite only baddies. That would be ideal!
Otherwise I cannot predicte the future for him.

I need to plant some trees. I also plan to plant some trees this year. There you go. Easy.

Plans for this year involve going to Oman.

The aa is such an idiot.
He has started making his own beer.
He bottled the first ever batch today and seemed very proud of himself.
He will be upset when I give it all to the pigs.
Though Kaelan and Aden took an unhealthy interest in helping him.

Lion King in London today!

Phew, my head is a little bit sore today!
Had a party in the NF chateaux. HK, SOF, May-Anne, Ricky and Lara were hear celebrating the new year.
We were swilling drink like it was going out of fashion!
Fireworks in the garden were a little bit less involved than those up at the London Eye but still entertaining!
Unfortunately Zorro got a excited with all the noise and bright lights and bit Lara (she is only 9 years old).
<p />
BTW I think Kaelan has a soft spot for Lara! They were playing at math calculations and code names on knapkins
in the May Flower, when we all went for a pub lunch. Vsweet.
