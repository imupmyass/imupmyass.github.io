Hi and welcome to the most interesting blog around.
Lots of new and fascinating updates about my life nearly every day.

Happy birthday to me! Oops I mean to Kaelan. Happy Mothers day to me!
<p />
I have a problem sharing my day with anyone but for Kaelan I will make 
an exception.
<p />
Kaelan chose where we took the dogs to today, the beach at Christchurch - much nicer
than Clay Hill. It was very chilly though. But at least on another trip, Aden did not fall into water. Well done Aden!
We walked along the beach to the train stop, then got the train back to the cafe, then had some ice-cream.
<p />
Then went to the Hare and Hounds. Very tastey food and warm inside.
Played Hangman during dinner, why not? We sat at a Reserved table and Kaelan read. But no homework was done. Thank God.
<p />
Kaelan is 9 now.

Clay Hill = muddy sh*t hole. Why does the aa insist on taking us
there to walk the dogs. He thinks it is amazing, I think it is boring. So
do the kids. Kaelan almost stopped halfway round - he felt the forest
was against him. Zorro ran away - chasing some deer.
Aden remarkably didn't get wet and I was illustrious through-out.

Come on! Get the cards sent! It is Mothers Day on the 6th and I want to feel adoration.
<p />
I WANT MORE CARDS THAN KAELAN!
<p />

<p />
Not long to go. 5 days till mothers day.
<p />
Something else happens on the 6th, but my memory goes....
<p />
Just remember my birthday as well.
<p />
<hr>
<strong>29 Feb 2016</strong>
<p />
Leap day. If I had been born on the 29th Feb, I would insist every day of the
year was my birthday, in leap and non-leap years.
In fact I do that anyway, so it would not matter. It is my perorogative.
<p />
<hr>
<strong>28 Feb 2016</strong>
<p />
Domestic day. For my staff of course. Roast chicken for lunch.
<p />
<hr>
<strong>27 Feb 2016</strong>
<p />
IOW today. Quick visit with some Epsom fans.
<p />

There may be conflict on the 6th of March this year.
It is of course Kaelan's birthday, but interestingly it
is also Mothers day.
<p />
Who will win out? I hear you ask. There
can only be one winner round here.
Let me assure you.

Back from Oman!
Great holiday, spent it with some goats, chickens and some Omani's.
Kids loved seeing Mosa and Hamed.
Kaelan is a bit deaf now. I think the flight may
have interfered with his ears.
<p />
<hr>
<strong>17 Feb 2016</strong>
<p />
I parped today.
<p />

<strong>14 Feb 2016</strong>
<p />
In Oman at the mo! Just a little sojourn.
I have big fans all around the world. I have to keep them happy!
I know what the Pope feels like.

Why would I not want to look after bees?
<p />
That is your question for today.

Kaelan saw Bella today, she was lying on top of the boiler.
She was spread eagled, without a thought to the rest of the world.
Kaelan shouted for help! He thought there was something
the matter with her! No Kaelan, that is cat life.

Aden asked where the dog hairs go from the carpet.
I explained that the vacuum cleaner scooped them up.
He then asked with increasing alarm where was the vacuum
cleaner and could it be checked!
I asked what for? He replied, he had lost his Rubicks cube
and the last time he had saw it was on the floor in his bedroom!
I said not to worry, and I had a look for it, it was in Kaelan's
bedroom next to his bed. The Rubicks cube is the latest toy
that is amusing them both.

Happy birthday Zozzeee! 3 today. I can't believe
he has made it. There have been quite a few points when
I though he might get put down. If cats have 9 lives then
I wonder how many bites dogs have? I think Zozzeee might
be running out!
<p />
Tezza has died :(  This a shame. He was the only
Irish person I liked. The Irish/Welsh/Scottish, I'd
be quite happy for them to be stuffed in to a rocket and
blasted into space, but Tezza was different.
Apparently he helped raise nearly &pound;900m for charity.
What a star!
We are stars!
<p />
Aden has been a good boy for a few weeks now.
What has happened?
<p />
Kaelan's behaviour has deteriorated.
<p />

Aden played tag rugby today, he was keen on the
rugby but not so keen on the doughnut afterwards.
He said he threw it away! Importantly, during
the game Aden threw the ball directly into his
team mates hands and his mate jumped over the line
and scored!
<p />

<strong>23 Jan 2016</strong>
<p />
Went for a walk today, by the seaside, by Christchurch.
We had just got to the beach when Aden nearly got washed away by a wave.
Seriously, he could have been swept away, but fortunately he didn't but did he get a good
soaking instead. He does have a habit of doing this, getting wet while out walking.
I may suggest he wears a wetsuit. I'm sure he would have a little moan
but it would cover damp eventualities.
<p />
While on the beach walk I decided to do some clearing up of rubbish.
I picked up a big blue plastic bag and used it to stuff
the flotsam into.
What's better I made the aa carry it.
I have the ideas and I get other people to do the doing.
And they have the audacity to complain?
<p />

Had a drive up to London on Saturday to see some Armenian fans, well
they don't come from Armenia but that is where they discovered me.
They have never been the same, their lifes are complete, especially
now that they have moved to England to be closer to me.
<p />
Kaelan and Aden were laughing about the Pirate Ned Smul and his
cohort Pirate A yesterday. Pirate A's real name is Pirate Ned A.
but you can't have two pirates called Ned! Pirate A has 4 eye patches:
one on each eye and ear. He see's through his bum, apart from when
he has diarrhea.

Yes, I live with two fat pigs! What of it?

<strong>11 Jan 2016</strong>
<p />
Its so funny. Should I say: I am so funny.
<p />
Though I am very sad at the loss of one of my favourite fans: David Bowie.
<p />
He was a very innovative fan, he would excel himself in the ways
he would show his enthusiasm. Very creative with his prose of admiration.
<p />
Hey Ass,<br>
You surpass,<br>
Even me.<br>
Hard to see,<br>
How it can be done.<br>
Must be that amazing bum.
<p />
I was quite touched when he sent that to me. Though I was a bit
disappointed he didn't release a single with my visage on the cover....
Or derriere for that matter.

Boys are back to school today! May send Zorro with them, see if
he can be taught to bite only baddies. That would be ideal!
Otherwise I cannot predicte the future for him.

I need to plant some trees. I also plan to plant some trees this year. There you go. Easy.
<p />

<p />
Plans for this year involve going to Oman.

The aa is such an idiot.
He has started making his own beer.
He bottled the first ever batch today and seemed very proud of himself.
He will be upset when I give it all to the pigs.
Though Kaelan and Aden took an unhealthy interest in helping him.
<p />

Lion King in London today!

<p />
Phew, my head is a little bit sore today!
Had a party in the NF chateaux. HK, SOF, May-Anne, Ricky and Lara were hear celebrating the new year.
We were swilling drink like it was going out of fashion!
Fireworks in the garden were a little bit less involved than those up at the London Eye but still entertaining!
Unfortunately Zorro got a excited with all the noise and bright lights and bit Lara (she is only 9 years old).
<p />
BTW I think Kaelan has a soft spot for Lara! They were playing at math calculations and code names on knapkins
in the May Flower, when we all went for a pub lunch. Vsweet.
