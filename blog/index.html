Hi and welcome to the most interesting blog around.
Lots of new and fascinating updates about my life nearly every day.

If a prole is frightened to speak to me because I am so important, that 
is their problem. Whatever they wanted to say would not please me anyway. I
could guarantee it.
Even if they did want to say something to me that could be important, why is a 
prole telling me, I know everything! 
Suffice to say they would be punished.

Wow what a fantastic party! Aden is a little over 7 years, but that is ok.
Best to have the party when everyone is not on holidays. Tom from tomfoolery
was doing his entertainment and making everyone laugh, proper magician he is as well,
he was wowing the kids with changing coloured hanker-chiefs and his circular ipads (they were actually elephant eye-pads!)
<p />
The cake I baked was amazing. Every one commented. One woman even fainted when she tasted it.
The kids loved the garden, playing in the tree house, feeding the pigs and chooks, and generally running around like headless chickens
themselves.
<p />
Tomorrow is pressie opening day. A lorry load is sitting, waiting to be opened. Oh how lucky my boys are to have 
such a popular mum!

Best party of the year tomorrow! Don't miss it! I have had a hall built, just for the occaision.

Though, perhaps if Henry had realised he wasn't very good
at relationships earlier, perhaps Anne and Kat may
have survived?
<p />
"Self awareness is the key to majesty", so said the Dali Lami.
Mind you, he's a softy. I'd rather be like Henry:
PUNISH and EXECUTE!!! That is Henry's way.

<p />
Chooks have laid their first egg!
<p />
I look to Henry as my inspiration for many things. Including how to conduct relationships.

Unfair, ruthless, cruel? Of course he was, King Henry VIII. My hero.

<p />
If I give a task to a prole in the village, and afterwards if they ask me if they can do 
that task, I punish them. Not because they are asking me if they can do the thing I have
asked them to do, but because I do not want them to do it anymore. But perhaps I still DO
want them to do it, but I just want to have a little fun.
<p />
I am a ruthless master, am I not :)

Chickens arrived. They are a bit roughshod. But now they are saved. They were meant to 
go for the chop today, but I am their God as well as their sovereign. Lucky chooks.
<p />
<p />
As you can imagine, the pigs are not quite recovered from their encounter with the black one yesterday.

<p />
Zorro got into the Pig Pen today. It was note a pretty sight. There were
friends of Kaelan and Aden in the garden, playing innocently. If I had never heard pigs squealing 
beforehand, I have definitely heard them now. They were frantic as zorro
raced round the pen intent on death. They knew he wanted them. He could smell pig fear. I COULD SMELL PIG FEAR!
They were trapped running back and forwards, and I tried furiously to help them escape, but they just wouldn't
fly. Zorro wouldn't give up either, no matter how much I screamed at him he just kept on going, like
a black dragon, breathing fire. To be honest, at points I thought I could smell bacon. Things could not get worse. Then
the aa arrived.
<p />
You can imagine how my heart sank.
<p />
What could the aa do? In this maelstrum.
<p />
First thing he did was dodge behind a bush! Idiot! But then after a few seconds, silence, then whoosh, a pig
ran out like it had just been farted out of Aden's bottom (when he has the runs). What had happened? I manouvered 
myself behind the bush and there was Zorro lying on the floor with the aa on top of him. Had the aa really caught
Zorro? I am unsure. The aa was out of breath, so he must've done something.

The Queen and me have a lot in common. 
Though I am no-where near as old as her.
My reign has also been gracious and glorious.
Though I am self-effacing and humble.
I am generous and caring; giving and listening.
I am selfless, not selfish in anyway to my subjects.
Though I consider myself lucky to be me, you are luckier.
<p />
That's not to say the Queen isn't like me, she just wants to be me.
She can look back on 60+ years of reign and see moments of betterness, in an otherwise humdrum mediocrity.
When I look back I see splendour and success.
<p />
For example, what was I doing 10 years ago? 
Meeting all my Jersey fans! You loved me, and I just tolerated you.
But that is what being royalty is all about. Infact, I have redefined royalty.
I have taken Henry VIII's regal methodology and brought it up-to-date.
Thug to Thuggess.
<p />
<hr>
<strong>10 Sept 2015</strong>
<p />
Kaelan said "Duh!" to me today.
I am pretty sure it is the first time I have heard him say this, this, this word.
Is it a word?
<p />

Piggies arrived earlier this week: Tony and SillyBilly.
One is pink and one is black. Both are girlies, Aden
wanted a boy and a girl but there was a mix up in the maternity ward. 
Not to worry. They are both very cute.
I had a little palace made for them, with beds and bathrooms. They
weren't too keen though, they immediately sneaked into a hole in
the foundations!
Ruuskii is trying to make friends with them, but his barking and
aggressive posturing don't seem to be working.
He should go on a piggy communication course. I will see 
if there is one available.

Aden pulled Kaelan by the hair today, along the floor.
Aden was in big trouble after that. Believe me.
Watching too many action films me thinks.
<p />

<strong>22 August 2015</strong>
<p />
Watched Indiana Jones today. I quite fancy myself as an adventurer.
<p />
Red bike for the boys arrived today, as if by magic. You my faithful fans, never stop giving.
Of course this is better for you than me.
<p />

<strong>16 August 2015</strong>
<p />
Went for a walk today, by the sea, the boys took a bike, Aden was cycling and decided to cycle into some
blackberry bushes. He was none too happy. Screaming actually, poor thing. Thorns sticking out of him like little
pins.
<p />

<p />
Went to Hobawick for a week. Got back yesterday.
Am recovering after the experience. Slowly.
Sid and Nancy were pleased to see my kids,
though I was not as happy, for obvious reasons.
Kaelan and Aden survived. That is always relief at these meetings.
Here is a rough list of things I acheived:
<p />
<ul><li>
Stayed in a caravan @ the Lakes.
</li><li>
Listened to the Pontificator.
</li><li>
Lifted the Pontificator to greater heights.
</li><li>
Visited a toy shop - Smythes in Edinburgh.
</li><li>
Climbed a volcano with SweetCheeks - Ruberslaw near Denholm.
</li><li>
Rode a pony - SweetCheek's Phoebe.
</li><li>
Watched Coldstream Common Riding.
</li><li>
Saw some underground trains.
</li><li>
Ate a chinkee - Local cuisine of some sort? 
</li><li>
Tried to visit St Mary's lock. But failed to find it (aa's fault).
</li><li>
Had some bannock @ Selkirk.
</li><li>
Built a table. 
</li><li>
Went rockpooling at Eyemouth.
</li><li>
Crossed a Joogly Brigg @ Branxholme.
</li><li>
Got licked by a calf @ the Joogly Brigg.
</li><li>
Spied through a telescope - at some sheep. Hobawick pastime, apparently.
</li></ul>
<p />
Haggis was on the menu one evening, I can assure you I did not even try it.
If I had, I would have been blocked for a week.

Lymmy Carnival today! And yes, I am the carnival hero! (I felt "queen" is to sexist in this day and age.)
But I will be on the lead float with my adoring villagers cheering me.
There will be camels and zebras and lions. I have had them flown over from Africa for the day.
I have organised a glass of pop for each my subjects. It will be, for many of them, the first taste
of something other than water that they will have ever had. Who dares to call me anything than
a caring ruler? Yes, I know I have had 3 or 4 flogged in the last year, but that was because they didn't curtsey
when I passed!

What is the greatest accomplishment of humans? 
Space exploration? 
Splitting the atom perhaps?
Creating wondrous paintings and sculptures?
Writing prose of great quality, like Shakespears plays or this blog?
Perhaps the philosophical and critical thinking that have shaped the millenia since Socrates?
<p />
No, I think it is the humble hoover.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY ADEN! My little star!
<p />
To celebrate I have taken my booboos to a secret location. It isn't a million miles away but I would rather not
tell everyone where it is, since it could ruin our privacy.

Founders Day today at Wallyhall. Michael Morpurgo is talking. Suprised I wasn't invited BECAUSE I AM A BIGGER STAR!
<p />
I'll give him credit. The kids found him entertaining. Though really, I would have been more inspirational.
He didn't talk about making sure you look great for your fans. That is the rule of my life.
<p />
Anyway, I didn't see anyone asking for his autograph. That says it all.
<p />
<p style="color: #999999; border: 1px solid #cccccc;"> 
<a href="../contact/">Comment</a> by WALLYHALL Headmaster:-  &nbsp; 
Good afternoon, I advised the parents and children of Wallyhall to not ask Mr Morpurgo for autographs
since doing so would constitute such common behaviour.

Went to the end of year year 2 party yesterday. It was fab. Most of us (me and the kids) were skinny dipping in the pool.
I was also skinny sliding down the bouncy castle, skinny trampoling, skinny almost everything!
The other parents didn't join in. But I didn't mind that. 
They are square.
<p />
Kaelan and Aden were there. As you can expect.
<p />
So was the aa. So what? I hear you say. Precisely.
<p />
Also had a dip in new my pond on Saturday. A bit muddy, but the boys don't mind that.
I tried to get the aa to take a photo, but he dropped the camera into the water.
He tried to blame me of course, but my hand was well clear of the strap when I
look my arm away. Idiot.

Blighter! He only went and had the highest scores in tests in English, Maths, Geography, History and RE.
He was the highest in the class and won the "Star of the Week" award!
<p />
Now I am trying to get out of buying an XBOX, but I don't really have a leg to stand on.
Though he wasn't top at French, so I may use that as an excuse. Doh, but I don't care about
French so, thats no good.
<p />
And Aden won a gardening badge. Luckily I hadn't promised him anything but I will buy him sweets. 
I'll try and persuade Kaelan to be happy with that as well. Fingers crossed...X

Pond is shaping up. No water in it yet (apart from rain). Interestingly the 
excavation has exposed tree roots. Yet there were no trees on the area above the pond
beforehand!
I can only assume there were trees before the field became a field. But how long 
ago was that?
<p />
Have promised to buy Kaelan an XBOX if he obtains the "Star of the Week" prize 
in his class. I don't have to worry. He is a tad too lazy to pick up that accolade :)

very enjoyable. Fed pigs, piglets, baby goats, big goats, ducks and calves.
Rode on a tractor trailer.
Petted baby chicks and rabbits.
Spoke to the owners about buying the place but they weren't too interested. 
So I asked about buying a pig instead.
They said they didn't have any little ones at the moment.

Also, I am getting sick of that idiot the admin assistant. 
He stops the kids playing a computer game called "Tanki" on the PC because they won't use the
correct fingers on the keyboard! Dim wit! Kaelan was going to explode today because the aa wouldn't let
him play, unless he used the correct fingers for manoeuvring the tank!?!

Ruuskii fell out of the house during the week.
He went for a sniff out of the Juliet balcony in my
bedroom and fell onto the bricks one floor below.
It was only 10 feet, but he covered the distance in 0.5 seconds and 
whimpered for an hour afterwards. Unfortunately he is still limping.
<p />
Boys went for a Maccy-D yesterday.
Aden caused such a caffuffle I am unsure I will go again.
He received (from his perspective) the wrong free "Home" (from the film) toy. 
Anyway, eventually I persuaded him to go up to the counter and get a
refund or exchange. I was hoping he'd get the money but instead he took 
a different toy.
Though I was disappointed, he was happy.
<p />
Also, the boys went sailing for the first time at on Saturday. I mean proper sailing, on an Oppie:<br>

<p />
Oh how I wish the Hobbits were an April Fools joke.
<p />
I am not returned to normal yet.
<p />
The world is never the same after a visit by them.
<p />
Sidney with his tubes and organs hanging out. Aden was quite perplexed when he saw.
<p />
Nancy and her fermented ways. She was distilled in a different time!
Quite an inebriated spirit, she spat at my windows most days.
<p />
I did believe that ALL animals were noble. To some extent. 
But where did their nobility go? I have a tendency to be inclined that they never did have any.
<p />
Their attitude is fiercest at meals times. 
I would throw out scraps for the foxes, 
but the poor things never stood a chance against these feral northerners.
<p />
Hobawick should be raised!! Cleanse the Earth of these oinks.
There should be exceptions to the "Animal Protection" rules that I am all for.
I will petition to the Animal Societies that the Hobbits should be squashed.
It is unfortunate but my elan vital would shine brighter, if that were the case.
<p />
Oh, I must sit down. I am quite over-come thinking about these animal oddities.
They are a bit like the Australian duck-billed platypus.
Nothing remotely related to them and no-one has any idea where they came from!

They have gone! I have been creeping around the house with locked doors and curtains drawn for 1 week.
I saw them snuffling around the garden from the bathroom window 1 week ago today.
I immediately went into "save my family" mode, as all good mothers would.
I locked and bolted the doors. 
I locked and bolted the windows.
I blocked all the toilets with a foul smelling poo.
I asked the mouse in the garage to lock his little door [he did].
I started a blazing fire to stop any infringement down the chimney.
<p />
They broke into the stables though, and lived their for a week.
But the stables were designed for animals, so that is ok.
I have ventured into the stables since they left, this morning.
They are a mess, I admit. And I doubt any living animal will be able
to stay in them again. Indeed, I will get them knocked down and start
afresh.
<p />
BUT ME AND MY FAMILY ARE SAFE!
<p />
That is the most important fact. WE SURVIVED A VISIT BY THE HOBBITS!
<p />
I am tired. Exhausted. I will recuperate slowly over the coming days/weeks.

Great party today! Kaelan and his friends (and Aden) were partying like they'd
never done it before. Especially Freddy. He was nuts.
Luke arrived. The real Luke Sky-Walker.
He wow-ed the kids with his magic and party games.
<p />
Darth Vader was there as well. So was Yoda. Though they
weren't quite as animated as the Luke. Thats probably because they
were card-board cut-outs. But they still impressed every one.

Party was in Boldre. As in shoulder.

Kaelan had his tooth knocked out by a "friend" last week. While watching a cross country race.
The two of them apparently got too excited. His "friend" raised his arms and on the way up they collided with
Kaelan's jaw.
<p />
Aden has a special reading chair. I will post photos soon.

Went to a disco on Saturday night. I was doing proper dancing. Creative dancing at its best. Yeh.
Lots of people were taking videos of me. They must want to copy me. Yeh. Me and Kate Bush
are stars of new contemporary dance. I can Wuther like no other.
<p />
<p >
I don't mind being an inspiration for you.
<p />
Going to get a pig soon.
A big fat one.
<p />
Then after that some donkeys.
<p />
Chickens are a definite.
<p />
And a cow.
<p />
Sheep as well.
<p />
Hope they can all get on in the same field! 
That shouldn't cause a problem. 
They were all were happy on the Ark.
<p />
I'll need to hire some more staff. On the other hand, that costs money, so I think
I'll just get the existing staff to work twice as hard. Yeh.

I got lost in Buenos Aires. Honest. I was with a group from the cruise ship
and they left me while I was taking photos. I was on my own for nearly 30 minutes.
What were they up to? Surely they missed me? Eventually the aa turned up give me
a whistle and thought it would be ok. 
I was quite upset. I thought no-one cared.
He said I should have been paying attention. I nearly punched him.
Idiot.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY KAELAN my booboo!!
<p />
8 is half way to 16! He is almost grown up!?!? How can that be? Only yesterday he was in nappies.
Eh I almost mean that literally. Though he hasn't had a poo incident for about a 6 months. Thank
goodness.
<p />
Interestingly, I found out about reusable nappies today. I only used disposable for my kids.
Perhaps I should get some for Kaelan. I'm sure he wouldn't mind.

Phew, what a holiday! Sunny and freezing all in one hol. 
Antartica was amazing, really beautiful (though I am #1, of course),
great fun (kids went to the "Fun Factory") nearly every day.
really cold (the aa made a snowman on the ship deck), 
So I can now add some more countries to my list:
<a href="../countries/">My Countries</a>.
<p />
I must admit I have put on a couple of pounds during the cruise. 
Too much delish food.
<p />
The kids enjoyed meeting Dejan (Croation waiter), Roco (also a Croation waiter),
Mr Penguin (another waiter) and Mr Washee Washee (some Asian guy
who hung around the entrance to the
Oceanview Restaurant spraying a cleansing fluid onto everyones hands - he liked dancing and singing PSY's Gangnam Style).
<p />
Went to lots of shows on the boat. Mikolosh was very interesting with his science talks and the dancing shows were amazing.
There was a juggler, who I wasn't so keen on, but he was very enthusiastic, only dropped his balls once (or was it twice).
<p />
Photos to follow soon!
<p />
Here is a list of animals we saw:
<p />
<ul><li>
Whales
</li><li>
Sea Lions
</li><li>
Seals
</li><li>
Penguins (in abundance)
</li><li>
Albatros
</li><li>
Kelpers
</li><li>
Dolphins
</li><li>
a Turtle
</li></ul>
<p />
The last two were only spotted by the aa, his claims cannot be substansiated so don't believe him.
<p />
Wow. Just checked my list of countries and there is only one letter that is missing: "Z"!! I need to
go to 
Zambia or
Zimbabwe to complete my list. Actually, I have never been to an "X" country, but there are none, so
that is understandable.

Went to the show of the year so far last night, a double bill:
"The Wind in the Willows" and "Alice in Wonderland".
Kaelan was an "extra", well to be honest, the whole of year 3 were extras.
So I should not be too disappointed he wasn't the lead.
And he did extra with guile!
<p />
Aden was with me. He quite enjoyed the first show, but during the
second one at every lull he would blast out: "Is it finished yet?"
A tad embarressing, but he is my baby booboo.
<p />
Off to Antarctica tomz!

What did the British Spitfire say to the German bi-plane? Bye plane!!
<p />
That is Kaelan's latest joke. Not bad!
<p />
Aden's latest trick is to play the guitar. yes, he has started playing his first tune.
Then he is going to learn how to tune the guitar. Seems the wrong way round to me, but
I have helped him tune it previously.

Antarctica <a href="../imgs/2015/02/antarctica_itinerary.jpg">itinerary</a>.
The numbers are temperatures.
Expecting it to be a bit peaky at the South Pole.
Could be wrong.
But I will go with my hunch on this one.
Bought some anti-cold clothes today.

Aden struggles to have a poo now-a-days. 
Not because he has constipation.
But because of the ants.
Yes, apparently ants live in the toilet.
He stands up to have a poo. Until you assure him there are no ants.

SNOW this morning! Yipee.
<p />
Mostly gone by this evening :-(
<p />
Lots of snow in Antarctica!
<p />
Lots of work being done on the house at the moment. The attic is developing into a room.

Kaelan is reading at the moment. In fact that is all he does. 
Sometimes I think I only have one child: Aden!
<p />
Don't worry, Aden makes up for Kaelan, in noise and naughtiness.
<p />
Then, when Kaelan does go for it, it is like having a 2 year old.
So much so, I bought some dummies for my booboos recently. To 
try and shut them up.

Going on holiday soon. Antarctica! No joke. Holiday after that is to MARS!

Also, I fell on some rocks today, while at beach. Bloody seaweed.
Anyway, my ass saved me. It is big enough to catch a small planet!

with me. Poor thing.

Kaelan is playing Colditz at his school tonight. Hope he isn't too scared!
They play the game in the pitch dark and I know my booboos get frightened
easily.
Afterwards the competitors stay in the school over-night!
<p />
The game consists of the the pupils trying to ring a bell that
is protected by the staff. All the game is played outside and 
no torches allowed! Sounds exciting but I think Kaelan would be 
better tucked up in bed in his bedroom with a bottle of milk.

The boys started playing in their Lego building today.
It has been purpose built for them to enjoy all their Lego from Christmas.
<p />
Not that they are spoilt or anything.

Kaelan has picked up the dubious habit of speaking in a 
quasi northern accent. "Where's me shoes?" Whats for me breakfast?".
<p />
I am refraining from saying anything incase it encourages him.
However, where is this behaviour coming from?

Aden was a bit mischevious today. 
He set up traps for me and Kaelan to be surprised with.
<p />
One was very lovely, a drawing of some flowers, he left it in the cutlery drawer.
However, dropping teddys from above his bedroom door was a bit more naughty.
