Phew, my head is a little bit sore today!
Had a party in the NF chateaux. HK, SOF, May-Anne, Ricky and Lara were hear celebrating the new year.
We were swilling drink like it was going out of fashion!
Fireworks in the garden were a little bit less involved than those up at the London Eye but still entertaining!
Unfortunately Zorro got a excited with all the noise and bright lights and bit Lara (she is only 9 years old).
<p />
BTW I think Kaelan has a soft spot for Lara!
