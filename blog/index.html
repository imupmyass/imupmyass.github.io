Hi and welcome to the most interesting blog around.
Lots of new and fascinating updates about my life nearly every day.

<p />
The boys are growing increasingly interested in football.
This worries me.
<p />
Thankfully Kaelan still adores his little teddy.
He assures me he will always carry him around.
<p />
The boys are growing increasingly interested in Angry Birds Star Wards.
This REALLY worries me.
<p />
Aden still likes to be carried upstairs at bed time though.
He will never get too old to not be carried upstairs.
In fact they both will never get too old to be carried upstairs.

<p />
Getting chilly. Summer is just out the door.
Thinking of Christmas already.
Well, I never stop thinking about Christmas.
I'm a bit like Kaelan and Aden.
<p />
Also, the house seems quite a bit emptier.
Not so much singing.
And I have noticed things are not quite so clean.

<p />
My new phone was handed to me today. An iPhone 6.
It was handed to me, though I am unsure how to work it.
I thought it would be really hip to have an iPhone 6 until 
an 85 year old showed up in the shop with one, then
started to use it. She was really adept. I was quite 
embarrassed at my technological limitations.
I will persevere, if kids and grannys can do it,
I'm sure the generations in between can manage...

<p />
There is a violin in the house. It is Aden's. I will say no more.
<p />
The kraut has put pen to paper and written her <a href="../thoughts/#kraut">thoughts</a> of me.
<p />
Also, and unfortunately, Scotland is still with us.
What a lot of excitement for nothing. 
Its like washing your bum.
Finally I thought we'd get rid of those bits that cling-on.

"My most favourite person in my family is me". Now, sit down. I know
what you are thinking: only I could say such a narsasistic thing as that.
BUT NO! It was my booboo Aden! Oh like mother like son. He is perfect.
Mostly. But I AM MORE PERFECT!

Blog back on-line, you're glad to know. But on the Hub of Gits. Apparently. 
Instead of on the home server. Its the Web team being geeky.
<p />
Other news! The boys saw two Lancaster bombers flying over the house on Saturday!
My, the planes were like dragons, the way they roared. Then to top it all
off we all saw them flying along the coast on Sunday! I have some photos.
Must share.
<p />
The boys are enjoying their school. Really doing well. They both have been 
Stars of the Week of their respective classes.
<p />
Kaelan went to chess club this evening. He won two games, both against
older opponents! Aden received a love letter from his girlfriend in Epsom: Eva.
He wrote her a letter back. How sweet.
<p />
As for me? I will be crowned the village queen within the week.

In the NF. 
<p />
Been very busy. Went to Milford on Sea today with the boys, all 4 of them.
<p />
I have plans for this palace and village, big improvements.
<p />
2 boys have started school. Things going well, though Aden
seems more enamoured.
<p />
Kraut is here, doing the sewing and other household jobs.

<p />
Everything is Stars Wars at the moment.
My boys have watched all six episodes and they know the
story line word for word/scene for scene.
For Kaelan, ecstasy is Star Wars LEGO!
He is mental for it.
His Christmas list is full of requests for Starts Wars LEGO.
He helped me scan it yesterday. I will post it soon.
It makes for interesting reading.
Aden likes pretending he has a double light sabre. 
He weilds it like a true Darth Vader.
<p />
Also, I must inform you, this web site will be down while
I move. Only for a day or two, hopefully.
As long as my tech team have got their fingers out
and have an Internet connection installed in the new castle!

<p />
So busy getting ready to move into my new village.
They are waiting baitedly for their new Lordess.
I will not disappoint them. I will only tax them what 
is fair and proper for serfs.
<p />
Oh, and also been to France on hols. 
Will get the web team to post some photos up latez.

Aden was having a little tantrum today. About booster seats for the
car, of all things. During the hoohaa, Kaelan made a comment about
Aden, "He's quite minature!". I was quite confused. However, it
transpires Kaelan was trying to say "He's quite immature!".

Mary (the babysitter) let Aden eat too many plums the other day.
He had diarrhea afterwards.
Hope he learned his lesson. Adults cannot be trusted to 
look after children!

Been to Scotland. Long story. Much better places to go, I know.
<p />
In Sussex at mo. Looking at a very beautiful house. Deciding
whether to snap it up or not.
<p />
Will put up photos of the Scotland visit soon.
<p />
The music teacher was complementing Kaelan on his drum playing tonight.
<p />
Aden will only watch Power Rangers.
<p />
I am resilient through-out.
<p />
Mary was looking after them today. Stuffing them full of 
blackberries and plums from the garden.

<p />
I have not written any verse for a long time.
I feel a poem coming on. One that will
help you all.
<p />
.............................................
<p />
<b><i>The Reality of Perfection.</i></b>
<p />
My expectations are high.<br>
I never make mistakes,<br>
Therefore I never say sorry.<br>
Never have done,<br>
Never will do.
<p />
If you are performant<br>
And provide for my needs<br>
And exceed my targets<br>
By 125%<br>
You may receive my tenderness.<br>
<p />
For those of you,<br>
Who do not come up to my level:<br>
Perish.
<p />
Above or below,<br>
Being with me is reward enough.<br>
What else could you want?<br>
I am perfect.<br>
In the perfect sense of the word.
<p />
What is required of me?<br>
You dullard!<br>
Nothing.
<p />
Me in me and of me is enough for you.
<p />
To change is for loosers.<br>
If you were not born perfect,<br>
Then whats the point?<br>
If you have to stop and think,<br>
If you have to assess and learn,<br>
If you have to <i>try</i> to be a Godess....<br>
<p />
Bless you.
<p />
But you will never make it.
<p />
To my level.
<p />
Of course you can be my fan.<br>
That is quite ok.<br>
As long as you know,<br>
You have to pay for a signed photo.
<p />
I am free.<br>
So are you.<br>
But I only employ slaves.
<p />
I am one.<br>
You are two.<br>
Just accept it.
<p />
Give, give, give.<br>
Thats me.<br>
<p />
Compassion.<br>
<p />
Thats my strong point.<br>
<p />
Beauty.<br>
You can't buy it<br>
But I have it.<br>
I know.
<p />
Defended can be more than defence.<br>
Make it aggresive defence.<br>
Thats what Zorro does.<br>
Bite before you are bitten.<br>
Never let the weak in.
<p />
Is it me?<br>
Is it you?<br>
Good is me.<br>
<p />
Oh. Think I need a pee.<br>
Wait! An idea!<br>
I should bottle that pee<br>
And sell it on ebay!
<p />
God I am great.
<p />
So are my kids.
<p />
The admin assistant.<br>
Never made it.<br>
Lost the race.<br>
Right from the start.<br>
Never could he make it to upper case.
<p />
A perfect reality awaits.<br>
ISIS have the right idea.<br>
Like brand new plates.<br>
I will go to ikea
<p />
End.

Have discovered a disadvantage of having a soft top car: lions.

Aden is 6 today!! It is definitely a Power Rangers birthday.
Toys on the theme abound and he has a new pair of pyjamas
of the same. The admin assistant pretended to be a naijloch
but was quickly run through with a sword (or is it zord?).
I baked a cake. My children expect this from me when it is
their birthday. Of course I relish the opportunity of baking.

Kalean's other front tooth is beginning to shake.

Went to see How to Train Your Dragon part 2 this affo.
Aden had to leave, it was too scarey for him. Kaelan 
found it all too emotional, especially when Hiccup's dad
died. The goodies won in the end. Thats all that matters.
<p />
Pressies should start picking up tomorrow, for Aden's 
birthday. Don't forget!!

Birthday party today! The Power Rangers was the theme. Just
as well someone told THE Power Rangers to come. One did.
He was rippling muscle. Quite amazing.
Aden was the star, as he always his at his parties.
Danced like a Nailoch.
<p />
Kaelan has lost his front right upper tooth.
He looks like a propper school boy.

I have no idea how these things happen but Nancy breached the house defences last Sunday
and has made herself quite at home for the last 7 days.
First the wine went missing. But that is expected, though unwanted.
Then the boys started calling her Granny. I have no idea why they do this.
Then she started going the events that were quite obviously ear-marked for the
more better of us: the St Christopher (posh) school fair, the school show,
Sunday swimming, Little dragons etc... etc...
Do you know what it feels like to have a hobbit follow you around all day?
<p />
And to top it all off Zorro's balls have gone missing!!
I quite literally mean his testicles.
Where has she put them?
He is quite perplexed, as you can imagine.
<p />
One consolation, Sidney Hobbit hasn't made an appearence.
Though I do not want to speak too soon.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO ME!!!
<p />
Thankyou Thankyou Thankyou.
<p />
You are so kind.
<p />
Yes, I adore you. Only a little bit mind. I know you all
adore me with as much vigour as you always have. That
is the way.
<p />
To celebrate, Zorro bit an estate agent that came round to the house.
<p />
The kids drew me lovely cards of summer things. They are wonderful.
<p />
I am on such a high. Nothing could bring be down.
<p />
The weather is beautiful and the fruit is ripening in the garden.
What a wonderful time of the year to be born in. And what a 
wonderful thing to happen to the world: me.

Finally the aa has bought himself a car. Well, when I say a
car, it is a mini car. Not especially big or grandiose. Like
I would go for. But a vehicle with an internal combustion
engine, never-the-less.
<p />
It is one week to the biggest day of the year. I'll say
no more apart from: concert your efforts. Or there
will be consequences.
The World Cup may be on. But there bigger things
than that, you know.

<p />
Kaelan and Aden have started writing their Christmas lists.
Kaelan's is the most extensive, running to almost 3 A4 sheets.
Aden's is more modest at about 1.5 sheets of A4. Though I am
unsure if that is a reflection of Aden's more restrained needs
or the fact he is a slower writer. Probably the later.
<p />
Went to the Nonsuch Teddy Bear pic-nic today.
Boys loved it. Though I suspect Kalean may be feeling like 
he did yesterday when we went to the playground in Haywards Heath.
He said the games were too young for him. At 7.25 years old he thinks
he is above going to the playground. Oh how things have changed.
<p />
Also, here is a notice to any who enter my house and want
to use the conveniences:

The aa was having a kipper tonight for his evening meal.
Aden told him we shouldn't eat fish from the sea

The aa asked Aden if it wasnt ok to eat fish,
then why is it ok to draw a picture of a fish...
He spoke as if his question was somehow comparable to Aden's.

Kaelan also did well at school last week.
He did good at writing, maths and comprehension tests.

Yesterday, Kaelan asked how many teeth humans have.
I said 32 (quietly confident in my answer, though I hadn't counted for ages)
He then asked if I knew how many teeth Elephants have. I said I didn't.
Undissapointed with my response, he went on... "What is 6 x 32?" 
I answered 192. He seemed impressed.
He then informed me that elephants go through 6 sets of teeth in their lifetime 
and if they had 32 teeth in each set they would receive 192 pounds in total, if they got one pound for every
tooth they lost.
Thats my boy! Looking to make money at every opportunity.

Aden's sore ear was nothing to worry about. Teachers panic now-a-days.
<p />
Importantly Aden is useful around the house!
Today he spotted a bit of dirt on the floor in the hallway
and promptly switched on the hoover and hoovered it up!!
Bravo!

Of course I do not need to remind you what happens next month.
Kaelan's 7th birthday!
Oh how I wish he was a baby.
Why do people think babies need to grow up.
We can be babies for ever. If we want.
Just because we don't fit in your box!
<p />
Aden is favouring Power Rangers on the TV at the moment.
Power Rangers is for babies.
Don't think otherwise!
Don't box them in your box!

Kaelan has sussed out the admin assistant. "You're stupid!" Kaelan
says with a snarl on his lip when the aa is not fulfilling his wishes. 
<p />
Going to yoga at the moment. Getting quite good at it. Am advanced.
Doing the head stand at the mo. I don't mean literally at this moment!
At the classes I am attending in this period of time.

Been to Beachy Head today! Got there too late though. Someone
had flung themselves off the cliff by the time I got there.
If only they had seen my beauty. Male or female, that
would have saved their souls. 
<p />
Then to Eastbourne! The boys got their feet wet on the beach.
And I don't mean the dogs!

What do you expect if you put a whoopee cushion under my ass?

It not to break!

Aden was crying, it was a present from a birthday party
he had been to today. Sorry Myles.

Kaelan's favourite animal from the Galapagos was the blue
footed boobie. It is a bird.
<p />
Aden's favourite animal was the penguin. Second were the black frigates.
Apparently they are the pirates of the seas.

Aden doesn't <i>take</i> a chess piece from the opposition, he <u>kills</u> it.
<p />
Kaelan remarked that two pawns which had been taken by their
respective opponents were still fighting in chess heaven.
<p />
They both seemed to very in to Chess while in the Galapagos.

We saw a shark in the Galapagos. Quite a big one.
Sharks are everywhere, I have noticed.
<p />
The boys learned the rules of chess whilst in the
Galapagos. Well, the aa tried to teach them, so not sure
how accurate his interpretation will be.

The dogs had the cat between their teeth yesterday (at the same time!).
Had to take poor Bella to the vets but she was ok.
Not sure bringing her into the house was a wise thing to do. 
Zorro is 1 today.
He has a lot to learn.
<p />
Other than that?  I met the most stupidist man I have ever met
yesterday.  Story goes like this, I went to see a prospective house
with the nanny, there was a young gentleman outside who started
speaking to the nanny, he asked if I was her mum. Say no more. I gave
him a kick in the goolies and we hastily left. Not only do I look
young enough to be her sister, I could be her younger sister!!  Idiot.

The Galapagos Islands lived up to their reputation. Vimpressive.  Must
say. Wild and romantic, like me. Young (relatively) and inspirational,
like me. Fiery and a bit sharp at the edges, like me.  Loads of photos
and stories to follow. Though the highlight of the holiday was for the
animals of course. They didn't try to run away from me or anything.
They felt totally calm in my presence. In fact I thought some of them
were over-whelmed. The turtles were lovely, so were the rays, they
almost tried to come out of the sea to meet me!

Galapagos tomorrow. Yes, THE Galapagos islands.
Expecting to do a bit of wildlife watching.
May even discover the odd new species or two.
May go scuba diving....
<p />
Going with the kids of course. The aa is coming along, only
to carry the luggage. He will follow the cruise ship in a dinghy
around the islands.

Bought boys bottles yesterday.
<p />
Bottles for milk. You know, like the ones for babies.
<p />
I think its important to make them feel as though are still booboos.
<p />
They enjoyed watching a video of Kaelan drinking milk from a bottle
when he was't even a year old, so why can't they emulate that when
they are 5 and 6 years old? Kaelan is nearly 7.  SO WHAT!

The boys got caught in a storm today on the Epsom Downs.
Almost blew them away! They were out looking for branches
to make more wands with. Harry Potter has a lot to anwser
for!
So does coca-cola! It makes them feel a bit drunk when
they have too much of it. They went to the Derby Arms, at
the edge of the Epsom downs, and drank a whole bottle each.
They both enjoyed it. Though I think they enjoyed the
pictures of naked ladies bottoms in the Gents toilets more!

Happy NEW Year to all my faithful fans! You LOVE me so much!!
<p />
Some of you are ok, but I wouldn't go as far to say that I love
any of you. Some of you are quite smelly and ugly, but 
I do appreciate that you are my fans. Thankyou!
