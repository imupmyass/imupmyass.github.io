That was done by the kids.

Went to the show of the year so far last night, a double bill:
"The Wind in the Willows" and "Alice in Wonderland".
Kaelan was an "extra", well to be honest, the whole of year 3 were extras.
So I should not be too disappointed he wasn't the lead.
And he did extra with guile!
<p />
Aden was with me. He quite enjoyed the first show, but during the
second one at every lull he would blast out: "Is it finished yet?"
A tad embarressing, but he is my baby booboo.
<p />
Off to Antarctica tomz!

What did the British Spitfire say to the German bi-plane? Bye plane!!
<p />
That is Kaelan's latest joke. Not bad!
<p />
Aden's latest trick is to play the guitar. yes, he has started playing his first tune.
Then he is going to learn how to tune the guitar. Seems the wrong way round to me, but
I have helped him tune it previously.

Antarctica <a href="../imgs/2015/02/antarctica_itinerary.jpg">itinerary</a>.
The numbers are temperatures.
Expecting it to be a bit peaky at the South Pole.
Could be wrong.
But I will go with my hunch on this one.
Bought some anti-cold clothes today.

Aden struggles to have a poo now-a-days. 
Not because he has constipation.
But because of the ants.
Yes, apparently ants live in the toilet.
He stands up to have a poo. Until you assure him there are no ants.

SNOW this morning! Yipee.
<p />
Mostly gone by this evening :-(
<p />
Lots of snow in Antarctica!
<p />
Lots of work being done on the house at the moment. The attic is developing into a room.

Kaelan is reading at the moment. In fact that is all he does. 
Sometimes I think I only have one child: Aden!
<p />
Don't worry, Aden makes up for Kaelan, in noise and naughtiness.
<p />
Then, when Kaelan does go for it, it is like having a 2 year old.
So much so, I bought some dummies for my booboos recently. To 
try and shut them up.

Going on holiday soon. Antarctica! No joke. Holiday after that is to MARS!
<p />
Misc <a href="../imgs/2015/01/17/">Phone Photos</a>.
<p />
Also, I fell on some rocks today, while at beach. Bloody seaweed.
Anyway, my ass saved me. It is big enough to catch a small planet!

Aden missed Kaelan last night, he had to spend the first part of the night
with me. Poor thing.

Kaelan is playing Colditz at his school tonight. Hope he isn't too scared!
They play the game in the pitch dark and I know my booboos get frightened
easily.
Afterwards the competitors stay in the school over-night!
<p />
The game consists of the the pupils trying to ring a bell that
is protected by the staff. All the game is played outside and 
no torches allowed! Sounds exciting but I think Kaelan would be 
better tucked up in bed in his bedroom with a bottle of milk.

The boys started playing in their Lego building today.
It has been purpose built for them to enjoy all their Lego from Christmas.
<p />
Not that they are spoilt or anything.

<p />
Kaelan has picked up the dubious habit of speaking in a 
quasi northern accent. "Where's me shoes?" Whats for me breakfast?".
<p />
I am refraining from saying anything incase it encourages him.
However, where is this behaviour coming from?

Boys are back to school tomorrow! 
They have much to learn. 
Though I don't think they think that.
<p />
I know everything.

Aden was a bit mischevious today. 
He set up traps for me and Kaelan to be surprised with.
<p />
One was very lovely, a drawing of some flowers, he left it in the cutlery drawer.
However, dropping teddys from above his bedroom door was a bit more naughty.
