Suffice to say i have a survived another hobbit Christmas. Not sure how many more I can cope with!!<br><br>It was a Harry Potter weighted one. 3 films with lots of practicing with pretend wands afterwards.<br><br>The &#096;in&#096; toys were a Droid Carrier from Star Wars and Play mobile Vikings. <br><br>They boys were spoiled by Nana Nancy and Sidney Hobbit. I mean spoiled in a literal sense, they will never be the same.<br><br>Aunt Polly and Weevy Woo showed us their pony, very sweet, though unfortunately Maddie didn&#096;t feel too well on our visit.<br><br>DFW was checking out sheep with his new telescope! What can I say? He made excuses about their being too much cloud to see any thing celestial.<br><br>Princess Leah was looking wonderful. Like and angel.<br><br>Sidney was taken to a witch hobbit doctor, very shamanistic, and they are still testing Sidney&#096;s bile. Hopefully he will survive.<br><br>Nana Nancy was busy scurrying round the area that passes for a kitchen in the hobbit burrow. Some things were edible. Some things not. I have come to expect that. The boys as always seem to enjoy the concoctions....

The boys have taken to skipping every where. Kaelan is the most successful. Aden less so. Aden runs, then does a little trip but says it is a skip. They are both very cute though.<br><br>Took them to Toys`r`us today. They had a field day. Aden`s favorite toy was a black dragon: a night fury!! Kaelans favourite was Star Wars: a drone carrier. That makes sense since he wants to be a Jedi when he grows up.<br><br>Aden hasn`t said what he would like to be.

So many after school activities for the boys. Yesterday: tennis! Though I am not sure if having a tennis racquet in your hand but not hitting a ball is tennis. Pretend tennis! That is what it is.

Quite gross. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>03 Jul 2012</strong> <p /> It really is a never ending story. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>01 July 2012</strong> <p /> We went to the HSBC fun day yesterday: <a href="../../imgs/2012/06/30/">Photos</a>. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>27 Jun 2012</strong> <p /> Kaelan came up with a very astute insight today: Edo (the dog) wags his tail to keep it cool in the summer. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>24 Jun 2012</strong> <p /> The admin assistant claims to have stood on one of <a href="/imgs/radds_mountain_viper.jpg">these</a> today!! It is a Radde's Mountain Viper and deadly to humans. Of course I do not believe him, he is such of a drama queen is was probably a bit of string or such like. Though I must say he did look rather white when he came back to the  car carrying Aden and shouting "Get in the car, get in the car, I've stood  on a snake!!" We were on the way to lake Sevan and apparently you do get a lot of snakes up that way... My sentiments are.... why the hell did it not BITE him! <p /> <hr> <strong>21 Jun 2012</strong> <p /> I forgot to mention, Aden quite spontaneausly started swimming on his back recently. Quite remarkable since he has only been swimming for a month. Just like an upside down little froggy. <br> <br>Unfortunatley he is not excelling as much at his piano lessons. That is Kaelan`s forte. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>20 Jun 2012</strong> <p /> Happy birthday to wonderful ME!! Lovely, glorious li'l old me. Oh and thankyou for all my presents. I received a lollipop from Aden, some lozenges from Kaelan and a Twix from the admin assistant. But most of all, thank you for all the cards, it will take me at least 6 months to read through them all. Thankyou once again. But most of all thanks must go to me! <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>17 Jun 2012</strong> <p /> Horovats <a href="../../imgs/2012/06/16/">Photos</a>. <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>15 Jun 2012</strong> <p /> <a href="../../imgs/2012/06/15a/">Photos(a)</a><br> <a href="../../imgs/2012/06/15b/">Photos(b)</a><br> In one of the photos you can see how near the queen got to me. She was lucky!! <br> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>11 Jun 2012</strong> <p /> Aden booboo is not well today. I think it might be tonsilitis, though we are going to go to the doctors, they will only confirm what I suspect. I am never wrong, you see! <br> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>12 Jun 2012</strong> <p /> You see how self-less I am! Even though my birthday is before Aden&#096;s I only ask you to consider him. I am amazingly generous. I expect nothing and would give everything away. Ghandi and me have a lot in common. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>11 Jun 2012</strong> <p /> Aden booboo is not well today. I think it might be tonsilitis, though we are going to go to the doctors, they will only confirm what I suspect. I am never wrong, you see! <br> <br>As I feel is necessary, you will be reminded that it is Aden&#096;s birthday next month. Please do let him/yourselves/OR ME down! Presents a-plenty please. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>05 Jun 2012</strong> <p /> Kaelan had a little fright. He accidentally tried to swallow an apricot stone. He was choking and I was quite paralysed. Thankfully the admin assistant did something useful (for once) and lifted Kaelan up, bent him over by his waste, so his head was lowered, then gave him a quick thump to the middle of his back. Out it popped, straight into the bin. Oh it is most frightening to see your little one start to change different colours. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>04 Jun 2012</strong> <p /> The pageant was very interesting, I must say. But of course the most interesting boat was the one I was in. Do you want to see it? <br> <br><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18320076">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18320076</a> <br> <br>Go to that link. I am on the boat that is parked (do you park boats?) next to the London Eye. There are actually two boats parked on the boatpark (are where boats park called boatparks, like carparks?) I am in the front one. As the boat drives away (do you drive boats?), you can see me and the kids, if you look very carefully. <br> <br>So there we have it. Being in with the Royals gets you everywhere. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>02 Jun 2012</strong> <p /> Off to the Thames tomorrow, for the pagaent of 1000 ships. Hope its not too choppy. We get sea sick... <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>31 May 2012</strong> <p /> The swallows have arrived en masse. Like a thousand  <a href="../imgs/2012/05/night_fury.png">Night Furys</a>. <br> <br>We have cherry/apple/pear/apricot and other kinds of fruit trees in the garden. We also have some strawberrys/raspberrys/redcurrent bushes. The first fruit of the year has readied itself to be gobbled up in the last few weeks. However, yesterday when I went to take the children out to collect some, it had gone!! Cherrys and strawberrys were on the menu but they had disappeared. I was angry and flummoxed at the same time. I went to the security guard, "where fruit mine is", I said in my best Armenian. The guard, Artur is his name, advised me he had seen the gardener slink away a short while before with a suspicious looking hold-all under his arm. I asked Artur to call said gardener. He admitted to everything over the phone. I sent the aa to retrieve the stolen goodies and once more my children were able to stuff their faces rotten with tastey fruit. These Armenians! They give the impression of being honest and trust-worthy but I fear it is a falsehood. <br> <br>Going to England tomorrow. Me and Queenie have much to celebrate!! <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>23 May 2012</strong> <p /> Nothing much happening today. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>22 May 2012</strong> <p /> At the weekend Kaelan got a bit embarressed when I needed to change his T-shirt in front of some other children. He said "but I`ll need to show my bare belly!". Aden is not such a woos! Neither am I. I am quite happy to bare all for anyone!! As long as there is money in it of course. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>18 May 2012</strong> <p /> My boys have discovered a new activity that they find especially amusing. Before having a bath, I instruct them both to have a pee, otherwise as soon as I put them in the tub, they both say "I need a peepee!". Now however, when they are both peeing, they have noticed how much fun it is to make their streams of pee cross over! A boy thing, I suspect. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>11 May 2012</strong> <p /> <a href="../../imgs/2012/05/11/">Photos</a> from the QSI Armenia sports day. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>10 May 2012</strong> <p /> You see!!! <br> <br>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-18012571 <br> <br>Bloody Irish. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>07 May 2012</strong> <p /> Kaelan had a football lesson today. Aden couldn't participate because he is too young. This wasn't a problem for him, since he became an impromptu ball-boy. He was very good at it. As for the lesson, Kaelan was a bit apprehensive at first, and was a bit tearful when he get knocked over. The other boys and girls are all a bit older and bigger than he is. However, the admin assistant was there and he was he was nominated to be goalie while the children took shots at trying to score against him. Kaelan scored 2 goals against that moron! Oh you should have seen him run and slide onto his knees like a proper Premier league star! <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>06 May 2012</strong> <p /> Both my boys were swimming in the pool on there own today! Kaelan has been doing it for the last few occaisions, but Aden was the star today!! Off he went! Once he started he couldn't be stopped. Didn't  want to get out of the pool. He had floats on of course and he had a rather peculiar style, almost like he was walking instead of swimming. But his feet were at least 1 foot off the bottom of the pool and it did work, but his propulsive motion was not very rapid. But that did not dampen his style!! <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>05 May 2012</strong> <p /> Went to gymnastics today. The kids, not me!! hahaha. Though I have the physique to be a gymnast. Don&#096;t you think? The boys struggled with their first attempts at press-ups. But they seemed to enjoy the running around. <br> <br>Did you see the explosion at the government rally yesterday? Balloons filled with natural gas! Idiots. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>04 May 2012</strong> <p /> oh, i forgot, there is one thing worse than the hobbits; the irish: <br> <br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrBLqp-s__o <br> <br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHDX9qb2-BQ&feature=related <br> <br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsGapy5vQ&feature=related <br> <br>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdxLxnhGnvo <br> <br>shoot em all! Thats what I say. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>02 May 2012</strong> <p /> Oh what an idiot! You cannot trust that moronic admin assistant to do anything. He left the keys for the Yerevan house in London!!! He tried to blame me of course but his idiocy is so pronounced he did not even convince himself. <p /> So, back in Yerevan we are. Spring has defo taken hold over here. 20 degress when we landed at 10:30pm at night! <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>01 May 2012</strong> <p /> Happy Birthday to Sweetcheeks Tottman! <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>28 Apr 2012</strong> <p /> Weather has been poo here in England. Bit disappointed, but as usual my brave decisions win through. Went to Legoland yesterday and it peed down all the way there but as we got out the car in the Legoland car park the sun was beating down. First thing was to go to the Star Wars attraction, kids loved it. May have to show them the films. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>24 Apr 2012</strong> <p /> Things are progressing with my boys. They can now play for numerous hours without fighting. Hopefully they will become good friends as they grow older. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>22 Apr 2012</strong> <p /> Went to the London Transport Museum today. I want my kids to wear green anoraks when they are older you know. <br> <br>Scooby Doo is the film they watched tonight. Hope they don&#096;t have nightmares. Oooh Shaggy!! <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>20 Apr 2012</strong> <p /> SPOOKY!! Kaelan and Adens latest fad is spooky things. Like listening to a spooky song CD they have. Kaelan just plonks himself next to the CD player and listens to the whole thing!! Ghost Busters is one of his favourite tunes. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>12 Apr 2012</strong> <p /> <a href="../../imgs/2012/04/07/">Photos</a> of the party of the year!! Though Aden's could be bigger! <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>10 Apr 2012</strong> <p /> Ah, the daffies are starting to bloom... Or should I say, the ones that Aden did not pull the heads off. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>7 Apr 2012</strong> <p /> The party of the year (so far) is about to take place here in Norke Marash. It is Kaelan&#096;s 5th birthday party!! All the celebs are making an orderly queue out-side the front gate, and it is only 9am!! Doors open at 2pm. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>2 Apr 2012</strong> <p /> Snow is melting away here in Armenia. Perhaps I should follow suit.... <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>30 Mar 2012</strong> <p /> Kaelan has for the last few months been dressing himself quite successfully. In fact he can get his jim-jams off and be dressed from top to toe in his school clothes pretty quickly. Aden is getting there, he can now get undressed and fully dressed without any help, more or less. Though he seems to like to put his knickers on the wrong way, as in both legs through one whole, or some such manner. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>29 Mar 2012</strong> <p /> Off to Lebanon! On a private jet of course. Wish my boys were coming with me. But it is very serious business I am dealing in, so I have to leave them behind. <br> <br>Who is going to read them bed-time stories? The admin assistant? I doubt it. Can he read? He can describe colours quite well, I`ll give him that, but shapes and textures? I think not. The Puppies book will have to be read on my return. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>28 Mar 2012</strong> <p /> Ugh! Thought I had deleted that reminder years ago. It is Nana Nancy&#096;s birthday today and thats all I have to say. <br> <br>Delete! No more reminder for next year. She&#096;s so old theres a good chance she won&#096;t be here anyway. <br> <br>Damn computers, they can be too convenient sometimes. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>27 Mar 2012</strong> <p /> Its spitting. Thats a phrase Kaelan and Aden learned today about rain and its volume. <br> <br>In addition to that I taught Arshak, our driver, the opposite. But it is too uncouth to put into writing. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>20 Mar 2012</strong> <p /> Aden is back at home, he was in hospital for a night. Poor thing. It was his bronchials again. They seem to close up when he has a virus/cold thingy. Some nebulisation seems to do the trick though. He is right as rain (more or less) now. I do wish he would stop doing this, but, realistically I am just glad he is ok. I didn`t stay with him over night. Got the admin assistant to do that. <br> <br>The boys had their first extra-terrestial experience this evening: they saw Venus AND Jupiter in the evening sky!! They were watching cartoons, just before going to bed, when I remembered they should really see the sight outside. The sky was dark blue, but no other heavenly bodies were visible (still too light) only a resplendant Venus and mysterious Jupiter, hovering next to each other. I said to Kaelan, "can you see them?". "Yes, yes", he said. "There they are", he pointed, eyes bulging from his 5 year old head. He then said, "Pluto is not there, its much too far away". No pleasing some people. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>18 Mar 2012</strong> <p /> Happy mothers day to me!!! Oh I am so special. I received cards from all my boys, and chocolates! A snickers bar from Aden and a Mars bar from Kaelan. Its the thought that counts (for all you cynics!). <p /> The admin assistant would like to wish Nancy a Happy Mothers day. I shall allow this. <p /> <a href="../../imgs/2012/03/18/">Photos</a> from Georgia. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>17 Mar 2012</strong> <p /> Don&#096;t forget what day it is tomorrow! I know my boys haven&#096;t. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>14 Mar 2012</strong> <p /> Went to Georgia for 4 days at the weekend. May find time to put photos up.<br><br>What an idiot I am. I asked the admin assistant how to spell "bears no resemblence". His advice: "bares..."! Now I look as stupid as him. My credibility has been damaged for good. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>06 Mar 2012</strong> <p /> A couple of <a href="../../imgs/2012/03/06/">Photos</a> from birthday morning. Happy Birthday Kaelan!! <p /> Ugh! Have you ever had a lovely day ruined, quite unexpectedly? The hobbits forced themselves on to my Skype Channel and started grovelling  saying they wanted to wish Kaelan happy birthday. Ok, so that is not so bad, but the worst thing is that when he graced himself in front of the webcam, they started singing (or was it snorting) Happy Birthday!! Oh the horror that followed nearly dislocated my ear-drums! <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>05 Mar 2012</strong> <p /> Tomorrow is a very sad day. My little booboo is not a booboo any more. I think I will have to take his teddy off of him as well. He is getting too big for one. <br> <br>NOT ON YOUR NELLY!! I am going to keep him like a baby until he is 21. We both prefer it that way. <br> <br>"Bad guys don&#096;t go to heaven. They go to bad guy heaven. Its a room underground." Kaelan, at 4 years 365 days (it is a leap year remember!!). <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>01 Mar 2012</strong> <p /> Only 5 more days to go!!!! <br> <br>You know what I mean! <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>26 Feb 2012</strong> <p /> <a href="../../imgs/2012/02/25/">Photos</a> from our recent Dubai/Oman trip. <p /> <p style="color: #999999; border: 1px solid #cccccc;"> <a href="../../contact/">Comment</a> by SHEIKCAMELMANY:-  &nbsp; Oh your highness Ass, why did you not visit!

My fans are loving me loads. <br> <br>We are returning to Dubai for a couple of extra days before going back to Armenia.

BLOODY SNOW!! <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>6 Feb 2012</strong> <p /> Kaelan`s birthday is in one calendar month, and, of course, it is a short one!! Only 28 days to get your pressies rollin`.

For example, a recent conversation went like this: <br> <br>Aden: I want to go downstairs. <br>Aden: Why? <br>Aden: Because I want breakfast. <br>Aden: Why? <br>Aden: Its morning time. <br> <br>Oh, so cute. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>28 Jan 2012</strong> <p /> Going to a Burns night tonight, a civilized one, I am glad to say. Not a Hobawick "amgantigitpisstutonyexpense" kind of affair. The Armenians like to do things in a cultured manner. However, I do grow suspicious of their claims that they are drinking water all night. Why would one drink small amounts of water from a spirit glass I wonder? I do hope it is not Vodka.

One of the programmes they watch on iPlayer through the BBC had a girl who was slightly wider than normal. Kaelan was the first to start: <br> <br> She&#096;s a fat girl. <br> <br>Then Aden joined in: <br> <br> Look at that big one. <br> <br>He continued: <br> <br> Look at that belly. <br> <br>Then in unison: <br> <br> Look Mummy, look!!  <br> <br>Finally, Kaelan: <br> <br> She&#096;s got a big tummy!! She&#096;s so FAT. <br> <br>I am at quite a loss at what to do. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>16 Jan 2012</strong> <p /> Darkness. That is thier latest fear. Not sure what has happened over the last couple of weeks but they are both quite worried about being in darkness. Aden even cries himself to sleep, he says there are monsters under the bed so I go in and check under it to make sure there are none. He doesn&#096;t believe me. Kaelan stops two metres away from his bedroom and refuses to go in until the light is switched on. <p /> <!-- xxx --> <hr> <strong>11 Jan 2012</strong> <p /> If Aden is a little upset at something, he is asking to go to the doctors. Poor booboo. <br> <br>Also, both of them can get a bit frightened at Dr Who. Especially the Tom Baker episodes. Mind you so did the admin assistant when he was their age.
