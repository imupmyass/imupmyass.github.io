		Some more new thoughts soon....

		Here are some of my fan's thoughts:
		</p>
		<ul><li>
<p>
From <a name="kraut">Jessy</a>, a special kraut.
</p>
<p>
Where do I even start when it comes to -> Astrid <- ?
</p>
<p>
I've learned so many things from her: 
How to run a household without her doing any of it, 
how to make clothes, washed at 30 degrees, look clean and not wrinkly, 
how to cook without her knowing how to, 
how to use electronic devices the proper way without her pretending to be from the Stone Age, 
but most importantly: How to prepare the perfect British "Cup of Tea".
</p>
<p> 
But not only I've learned great lessons for life when it comes to material things, 
I also learned how to spoil your dogs and kids, well actually.. 
her dogs are her kids, so - how to spoil your kids. 
Which kid doesn't want to have a real life penguin as a pet? 
Or the whole toy store on High Street in your playroom? 
Or going on vacation 5 times a year? 
Or get fed twice a day and go for a super long and fun walkie EVERY DAY? 
This taught me, if you wanna play hard, you have to work hard - not only for you, but for your progeny.
</p>
<p>
I've learned to take life not too serious - 
it's okay to not have a place to live 3 weeks prior to your planned moving. 
And the best way to take life easiest is to be sarcastic. 
Sarcasm confuses people and leaves them questioning what's true or not. 
It keeps them talking about you - which they need to do, 
because you're the most important human being on this 
planet and life would be so boring without you in it 
(Yes, I'm talking about you, Astrid).
</p>
<p>
I hope I taught you some things: How to run a household, 
how to cook not-frozen-food, how to use a laptop and an Iphone, 
how to give proper time-outs (5 mins minimum with up to an open ending), 
how to make a GPS stick to your wind-shield. 
I'm happy I didn't need to show you how to love your children unconditionally. 
It gives me hope that you're not too selfish after all. 
</p>
<p>
I'm gonna miss you - and your whole team behind you, 
including man, kids, cat and fish.  
See you later Alligator 
(To end my 'thoughts' perfectly, imagine it plays the East Enders theme song)
</p>
<p>
PS: It needs to be mentioned how many boyfriends I've met through Astrid. 
She is the perfect cupid!! 
</p>
<p>
PPS: There are so many more things, I could write about Arschtritt, 
but there is simply not enough space to name it all!! 
She's too special to fit into an ordinary thought-entry.

		Ali from London says 'Wow! I thought I was important untill I met Astrid!'.
		<br>&nbsp;
